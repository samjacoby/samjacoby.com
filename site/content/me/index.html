I'm a printer, programmer, and swampologist (temporarily) in Iowa City, Iowa. 

I work at [Formlabs](http://formlabs.com). 

In 2013, I graduated from the [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) Research Group at the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu), where I worked with paper and conductive inks. 

I graduated from Harvard in 2009, where I studied computer science and history. 

You can find me on [github][0], [flickr][2], & [twitter][1].  

Here's my [resume]({{ media_url('files/resume.pdf')}}), and a site where I very infrequently [sell my books][3].
