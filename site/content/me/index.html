I'm a printer, programmer, and swampologist in Somerville, Massachussetts. I work at [Formlabs](http://formlabs.com). I was a student in the [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) Research Group at the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu), where I worked with paper and conductive inks, and I graduated from Harvard in 2009, where I was a computer science and history concentrator. 

You can find me on [github][0], [flickr][2], & [twitter][1].  

Here's my [resume]({{ media_url('files/resume.pdf')}}).
