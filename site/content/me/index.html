I'm a printer, publisher, and programmer in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and a student in the [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) Research Group at the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu). I'll be graduating in 2013. 


Before that, I was a computer science concentrator at Harvard, where I finished up in 2009.
