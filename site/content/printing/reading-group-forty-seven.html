I first stumbled on "Todesfuge" while working in Nicaragau--and before I could read German. It was shocking, brutal, powerful. I read it in English, then in Spanish translation--parsing through the German as best I could. I've since learned German--or at least, learned German well enough to stumble through these. 

_A Reading for Group 47_ reprints "Todesfuge", and three other poems in Celan's original German, facing [John Felstiner's](http://english.stanford.edu/bio.php?name_id=49) powerful English translations. A frontispiece by the California artist [Dirk Hagner](http://www.dirkhagner.com/) finishes the deal.
