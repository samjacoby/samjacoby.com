The lines above, taken from Darwin's grumpy [letter](http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/10/18/163181524/charles-darwin-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day) to a friend, is a source of consolation to the not-quite Darwins among us: it says--"Hey, I may be one the greatest scientists of all time, but I'm not so sure about this shit." 

So Darwin was having a bad day. That's amusing enough--but what of these orchids? And why did Darwin hate them so? A quick web search pointed me towards [Angraecum sesquipedale](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=1&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=0CCkQFjAA&url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FAngraecum_sesquipedale&ei=E3U3U-zjBvLJsATYiIGADA&usg=AFQjCNFwLKM5C8kbwDZEq7MnTyNRsSLdfw&sig2=ikzu4P6gojrsViTkPK4tdg&bvm=bv.63808443,d.cWc), *Darwin's Orchid*.

Found only in Madagascar, *Angraecum sesquipedale* has an unusually long spur. Examining a specimen, relayed to him by a botanist friend, Darwin posited that any accompanying pollinator would have to be equipped with appropriately distended hardware. Imagine everyones' delight then, when "21 years after [Darwin's] death," a moth with just such a 25-centimeter proboscis was discovered. 

So inspired, I was initially thinking of printing the broadside from polymer, but put that aside in favor of more expedient digital printing. To that end, I started looking for good illustrations. I found what I was looking for at the Harvard University Herbaria, one of those odd corners of campus that I've always notices--greenhouses poking above its roof--but never had made it to. There, the alarmingly helpful staff pulled a number of books from the archives--pulling a number of scans for me on the spot. The below is taken from *Revue Horticole*, from the  Librarie Agricole de la Maison Rustique, Paris, 1860. Quite elegant, I thought!

The rest was easy. I snipped  out the text, pushed a few pixels around, and sent it off to the good men & women of the Puritan Press, who took care of the rest.  

As for Darwin? Apparently, he made it through that lousy day. His "Book for Murray" became [Fertilisation of Orchids](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fertilisation_of_Orchids), published by John Murray in 1862, and a classic in its field.  

"Darwin's Orchid" is set in Palintino and digitally printed by the Puritan Press in an edition of 75.
