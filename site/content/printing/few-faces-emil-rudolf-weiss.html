I published this small specimen book in two editions, German and English. Weiß designed a number of handsome typefaces that are still in use today. The Weiß Lapidar that appears on the title page below is especially handsome. Bound by the inestimable [Sarah Creighton](http://sarahcreighton.com), who also is responsible for the stunning pastepapers.

Hand-printed on a Korrex cylinder press on Zerkall papers.
