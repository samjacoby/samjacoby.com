_This is a project that brings together a broad set of my research at MIT_ 

{% mark excerpt %}
TapClip is a specialized capactive sensor board that I'm using as a test-bed for exploring ad-hoc user-interface design, and more broadly, self-made technologies.

I drew this one myself, which gives it that weird grown-up-kid quality.")}}

## StoryClip

Ultimately, I packaged what I'd done with the board into a submission for **Interaction Design & Children 2013**, taking place in New York City. Happily it was accepted. You can download it for your reading pleasure below.

I've also documented some of my process in a variety of briefer posts. Take a look.
