_This is a project bringing together some of my ongoing research at MIT_ 

TapClip is a pretty generic name, so I've called it _StoryClip_, as well. Essentially, it's a specialized capactive sensor board that I'm using as a test-bed for exploring ad-hoc user-interfaces. I've been playing with a handful of applications.
