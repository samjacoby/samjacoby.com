:  Fall ride outside of Boston.  

{% mark excerpt %}
Obeying a widely-known primordial need within the soul, I acquired a 1972 Honda motorcycle in the summer of 2013. It was (then) a 41 year-old machine and requires continuous attention. That is part of the fun. This is mostly a place for me to keep track of notes.

I've found great satisfaction in working on it: tracing down corroded electrical connections, adjusting the timing & valves, rebuilding the cylinders—a nice change of pace from the technological-computer arts where I usually find myself.

## Replacing Fork Seals
I wanted to get this done before I took the ride out to Iowa City. I've had a very slight leak on my front fork seals--not much, but enough to show an issue. Of greater concern are persistent handling issues I've had since I picked up the bike in the summer of 2013. I noticed it early on -- on one of the very first rides I took, in fact -- a pronounced wobble when deaccellerating from the 40s or so. It turns out that this is a fairly common issue, usually resolved by replacing the original head bearings with a tapered set. New fork oil could only help, though I think I've got deeper-seated issues there than just that.  

## Oil Pump Seals

## Oil Switch
I've been trying to track down an oil leak in my left crankcase -- it's never been an enormous amount of oil, not enough to stop me riding, but a pain nonetheless. I've done the little tricks with the baby powder, and I thought it was the oilpan seal for awhile.  

I've been having a long-standing leak
