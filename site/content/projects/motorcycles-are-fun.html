Obeying a primordial need within the soul, I was compelled to acquire a 1972 Honda motorcycle. As of this writing, it's a 41 year-old machine, and requires continuous attention. That is part of the fun.  

I've found great satisfaction in working : tracing down bad electrical connections, adjusting the tappets, changing the tires,  my hands dabbed with oil, inhaling petroleum's intoxicating bouquet. Why, I just might write [a book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance) about it.{{ macros.render_footnote("zen-1", "†") }}
