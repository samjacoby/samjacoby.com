summary: In which I greet you, gentle reader.

With some consternation, I've overhauled my website. Much is due to the fine work of [Steve Losh](stevelosh.com), whose work I've assiduously cribbed here--as well as the programmatic stylings of the [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/) Project, whose framework I use here. The [Golden Grid System](godengridsystem.com) gave me all of the nifty "Responsive Web" tricks for free. Thanks.

The code for this website is hosted on GitHub: https://github.com/samjacoby/samjacoby.com. Not much to see, but knock yourself out if you're so inclined.
