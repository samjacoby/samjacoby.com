summary: In which I greet you, gentle reader.

With some consternation, I've overhauled my website. 

Much is due to the fine work of [Steve Losh](http://stevelosh.com), whose work I've assiduously cribbed for some time, both in web design, `.vim` configs, and much else.

This site is powered by [Hyde](http://hyde.github.com/), which is complex enough to make me feel smart--and simple enough to be actually useful. The [Golden Grid System](http://goldengridsystem.com) gave me all of the nifty "Responsive Web" tricks for free. Fun fact: I helped put the e-book together for [A List Apart](http://alistapart.com) back when I worked for Threepress.

The code for this website is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/samjacoby/samjacoby.com). Not much to see, but knock yourself out if you're so inclined.
