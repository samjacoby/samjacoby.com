summary: Whipping together some quick prototype circuit boards.

My circuit board order came in -- it's always astonishing how tiny the things are, these boards are about the size of two postage stamps, side-by-side. The "barebones" option from Advanced Circuits is a pretty good deal. These cost $8.90 apiece, which seems pretty reasonable. I know that [APC Cicrcuits](http://apccircuits.com) has really quick turn-around for boards with solder mask and such, but I didn't need it. I'm mostly proud for remembering not to pour a groundplane, as it makes it a pain to solder.

I used a bunch of `0603` resistors to provide the loads on the capacitive pads (those rectangles along the top). Those suckers are small. What's all the more astonishing, is that there is yet a *smaller* size, 0402, which is about the size of a grain of sand. And Brian was telling me that some special-purpose boards can have the passive elements like those baked right into the various layers.

I had to catch a flight out to LA--though it was delayed 2 hours--but I managed to throw together a board to bring with, so I could do some work on the plane (I ended up not doing any). After puzzling for a minute why the `FTDI` programming only worked the first time after burning the Arduino bootloader, I realized that I hadn't put in the auto-reset capacitor between the `DTS` pin of and the `RST` line.
