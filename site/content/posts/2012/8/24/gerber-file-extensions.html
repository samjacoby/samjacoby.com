Every time I send off Gerbers for production, I am baffled by the array of files that the CAM job in Eagle generates. I've culled these from the Internet. 

To the best of my knowledge--using [Advanced Circuits](www.4mypcb.com), these are the file extension mappings using the Eagle Gerber RS274X cam file. I may have once changed the default extensions randomly a few months ago--so handle with care. There are some inconsistiencies as detailed [here](http://www.protoexpress.com/content/gerber_extensions.jsp). A nice summary [here](http://www.cs.uml.edu/~fredm/courses/91.548-spr03/eagle-gerber-output.shtml) as well. Thanks, Fred.

At any rate, we'll see how the boards come out:

- **.cmp** / top copper

- **.drd** / NC drill from excellon.com

- **.dri** / *also* an NC drill file. Do we need both? I don't know. Probably not. But someone told me to generate the excellon paths once, so I do. 

- **.plc** / top silkscreen

- **.sol** / bottom copper

- **.stc** / top solder mask

- **.sts** / bottom solder mask

- **.gpi** / screw this one. General board info. Not needed.
