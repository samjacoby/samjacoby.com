I've used Arch Linux for years -- always a bit ineptly, I must admit -- and a while back, mostly because of Adobe CS, I switched to Mac. I've been pretty happy since, but there's something about coding in Snow Leopard or Lion or Cat or whatever we're on, that I've never really liked.

I've always had another machine around--a Thinkpad X40--which accompanied me on a six month jaunt in Central America and has earned my devoted trust and affection since. I've since amassed a small collection of the things--you can get one in working-order on Ebay for around $65 bucks, last I checked. I'm presently running Arch off've a 4GB USB stick (the ones on Ebay almost never have drives). I couldn't be happier.

One raw spot has been the Arduino IDE. I've been using [Brian Mayton's](http://bdm.cc) Makefile to compile my programs there--but honestly, I love the convenience of the Arduino libraries and all the rest, even if they're anethma to Assembly Cowboy's.

So -- can you have it all? Vim, an X40, a tiling WM (Awesome and Xmonad) + Arduino? Sure. Doesn't mean it's particularly easy, but [Arscons](https://github.com/suapapa/arscons) makes the process relatively painless. Install the necessaries: 

    sudo pacman -S install python-pyserial scons  

Then copy the SConstruct file into your sketch folder, and let the magic unfold. Well, I should say, magic never comes easily. In my install--which had a version of avr-g++--a conflict prevented programs from compiling correctly. Don't be shy of editing the SConstruct file to make it work right for you--in my case, I just modified the AVR_BIN_PREFIX setting to point to the actual Arduino install of avr-gcc. I don't know exactly what was amiss, but it seemed to have worked fine.
