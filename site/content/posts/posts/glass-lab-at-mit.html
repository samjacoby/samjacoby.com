A venture-some crew headed off the [MIT Glass Lab](http://web.mit.edu/glasslab/). In the basement, off've of the Infinite--or more accurately, perhaps, directly below the Infinite. An odd corner of things--I'd assumed that it was a hold-over from the days when chemistry departments blew their own glass and the like. It's in the materials science department, I believe. So it goes.

Anyhow, [Peter Houk](http://web.mit.edu/glasslab/peeps_pbhouk.html) presented some of the Glass Lab's work to  [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) a couple of months ago--and he invited us back over to his place, to experiment with some new software that [Erik Demaine](http://virtualglass.org/team.html), among others, have been working on. It's called [Virtual Glass](http://virtualglass.org),  essentially a CAD tool, that lets you experiment with different configurations of _cane_, and then see how the cane will appear once pulled. I don't know if that's the technical term, but that's what it seemed like to me. Making glass has a lot in common with pulling taffy and baking--at least in these early stages.

It was quite a show. In corner one, we've got a dual furnaces, each heating a white-hot pull of glass. In the corner, a glory-hole -- an insanely-hot furnace in which dabs of glass are reheated and heated. A blowtorch off in the corner, braying its firey mess.

Watching Peter, Eric, & Marty work was impressive. They zipped around, waving flaming gobs of glass, while we gawked and generally got in the way. In the end, they managed to make one of the designs that we came up with. It seemed pretty intricate, involving bonding together several different pieces of cane in a variety of ways, and then dousing the resultant mess in yet more glass. Something like making an elaborate pastry. The finished cane came ot pretty cool too--this is part of the end, that they let me take home after it had annealed.
