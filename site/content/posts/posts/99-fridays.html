Thanks to the inestimable efforts of [Valentin Huen](http://colorsaregood.com/index.php), we pulled together _500_ IR Throwies for the Media Lab's 99 Friday's party series. 99 Fridays is all-out dance-party, albeit a very Media-Lab-ish one. It's spiced by projects that people pull together from their research--or whatever, really. I was racing against a <span class="small-caps">CHI</span> paper deadline, so Valentin heroically recruited a small army of people to scale up the [IR Throwies](/projects/ir-led-throwies/) project for the last party.

I had a batch that I tested with an Arduino and an IR light array. The array--it turned out--wasn't the right frequency of light, so though the response was good in the comfort of my office, once we were trying to blanket an entire space, it didn't work well. Valentin scrounged up some of the right LEDs though, and that worked fine. Read the goddamn datasheet: that's always the lesson. The IR transmitter was synced to Brian's OSC stream that distributed levels and FFT of various bands to whomever was listening. All the LEDs, then, pulsed with the music. Pretty good.

Testing functionality.") }} 

And here are the final batch. I wish I had some shots from the party with everyone dancing and all, but I had to take off once we had them working. We heaped batches of them around the room, and as the night proceeded, people attached them all over themselves. #FUTURERAVES.

Not a bad showing, all in all. And cheap -- though it starts to add up in quantity!
