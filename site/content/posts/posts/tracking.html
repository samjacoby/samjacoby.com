Inspired by [@jsvine's](https://twitter.com/jsvine) experiments in version-control at [drafts.jsvine.com](http://drafts.jsvine.com), I thought I'd expose some of the bones that tick beneath this [site](http://samjacoby.com/posts/2012/8/21/hello-world/). I put-together a small plugin that parses the git repositories that have been backing this site for awhile, and throws them up on the page. You'll now see a `Change History` towards the bottom of every page I've worked on. This one's got it.
