My circuit board order came in -- it's always astonishing how tiny the things are, these boards are about the size of two postage stamps, side-by-side. The "barebones" option from Advanced Circuits is a pretty good deal too. These cost $8.90 apiece, which is pretty reasonable. I know that [APC Circuits](http://apccircuits.com) has really quick turn-around for boards with solder mask and such, but I didn't need it. I'm mostly proud for remembering not to pour a groundplane, as it makes it a pain to solder.

I used a bunch of `0603` resistors to provide the loads on the capacitive pads (those rectangles along the top). Those suckers are small. What's all the more astonishing, is that there is yet a *smaller* size, 0402, which is about the size of a grain of sand. And Brian was telling me that some special-purpose boards can have the passive elements like those baked right into the various layers.

I had to catch a flight out to LA--though it was delayed 2 hours--but I managed to throw together a board to bring with, so I could do some work on the plane (of course, I ended up not doing any). After puzzling for a minute why the `FTDI` programming only worked the first time after burning the Arduino bootloader, I realized that I hadn't put in the auto-reset capacitor between the `DTS` pin of and the `RST` line. It works the first, because the bootloader itself holds the chip in reset (thanks, [Dave](http://web.media.mit.edu/~mellis/)).

**Update**

I soldered on the toothless alligator clips today (what gems! [[Newark](http://www.newark.com/silvertronic/502008/toothless-steel-alligator-clip/dp/82R5349)]) and drew up an aquatic sketch to have some examples to show folks for the workshop I'll be doing.
