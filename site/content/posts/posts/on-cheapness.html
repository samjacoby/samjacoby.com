It is unbelievable to me how incredibly inexpensive products are in American stores. With my relocation to Iowa comes a re-exposure to the pricing offered in America's great discount superstores. WalMart, post-back-to-school notebooks: 17 cents a-piece. A laminate dresser, 18.99. And so on, the parade of bottom-of-the-barrel prices assaults the senses and disrupts ones' sensibilities.
