This is the design that I drew the board up from. Looks pretty good, right? Well, I was happy.

I had another board made by the good men and women of AP Circuits. They did another bang-up job, naturally. You can spot one of these gems from across the room: circuit bling. I happily toasted it up.

The finished board, bristling with muxes and PGAs and all the rest.

Now, some of the savvier among you may note that there are substantial errors in this circuit. To those of you, I care not, for I forge ahead like a train in the night. So, at some point in the development process, I did something bad. And hardware ain't like software. Whatever you do gets baked in (I guess software used to be like that--no longer in our web-ish days).

After pouring the ground, so as to free some visual space for laying down components--I hid it--along with the airwires{{ macros.renderfootnote("footnote-fail-1", "1")}} that it came with. Naturally, I then promptly forgot I did any such thing, and proceeded my merry way, getting the board made and all the rest.
