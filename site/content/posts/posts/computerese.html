I work with computers a fair amount, so now and again want to keep track of things I've learned.

Say you've got a server running locallyâ€”and want to quickly it share it with the world?

  ssh -R <remote port>:localhost:<local port> sjacoby@<my remote server> 

You will need to enable `GatewayPorts` on the *remote* `ssh_config` (not your local machine):

  GatewayPorts yes  

Reload the remote sshd for the new config (on my Arch box):

   sudo systemctl restart sshd

 Your locahost page should now be available at `<my remote server>:<my remote port>`
