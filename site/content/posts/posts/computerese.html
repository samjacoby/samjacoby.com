## Sharing your localhost dev server with the world

Say you've got a server running locallyâ€”and want to quickly it share it with the world? You need a remote server that you have ssh access to.

    ssh -R <remote port>:localhost:<local port> sjacoby@ <remote server> 

You will need to enable `GatewayPorts` on the *remote* `sshd_config` (not your local machine):

    GatewayPorts yes  

Reload the remote sshd for the new config (on my Arch box, it's the below).:

    sudo systemctl restart sshd

 Your locahost page should now be available at `<my remote server>:<my remote port>`. Party on. 

## Pretty printing `json` responses,  

You've got this little slice of sweetness.

    python -m json.tool

And if you want to do it in Vim, go with:

    :%!python -m json.tool
