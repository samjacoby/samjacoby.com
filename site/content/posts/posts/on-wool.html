I love wool, that naturous (I mean that) fiber, thick with the sweat of animal longing. I first learned of wool in the annals of the Rivindell Reader--now, I believe, defunct in the printed editions. Ostensibly a catalogue, it was more an almanac. Grant Peterson compiled a compendium of aphorisms, as expressed through an artfully curated selection of bicycle-related products. 

They were expensive, but I ended up with a fine wool undershirt. It was made in New Zealand or Australia, or some home of handsome long-limbed people. Though it was an awkaward blue-purple, I never took it off. And what a marvel it was.
