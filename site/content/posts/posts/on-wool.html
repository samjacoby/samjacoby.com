I love wool. It's an obsecenly organic fiber, thick with animal sweat. It is hair. 

stripped from its charge and knotted in our service. The hair of an animal, woven and primped into something smooth enough to lay against our bare pink carapace. I first learned of wool in the annals of the Rivindell Reader--now, I believe, defunct in the printed editions, though living proudly on online. My dad started getting the Rivindell Reader starting at some point in my late adolescence, post divorce, when he took up bicycling seriously. It was a thick sheaf of newsprint, printed in green and black earthtones, dispatched from some Northern Californian idyll.  

Ostensibly a catalogue, it was more an almanac. The writer--and it took me a few years, even, to grasp that I was reading the work of a **writer**--carried his voice through with verve. 

I much later learned about Grant Peterson, a cult figure bicycle figures for his work designing frames for Bridgestone, and later, of course, Rivindell. In the reader, Peterson assembled a compendium of life-wisdom, expressed through an curated selection of bicycle-related products.  

They were expensive, sure, but that wasn't what he was selling. 

but I ended up with a fine wool undershirt. It was made in New Zealand or Australia, or some home of handsome long-limbed people. Though it was an awkaward blue-purple, I never took it off. And what a marvel it was.
