*This is a compendium of resources assembled for a workshop over the weekend of April 6 and 7 at SparkFun Electronics in Boulder, Colorado.*

### Workshop Description
We’ll explore conductive inks and other materials to create unique, interactive musical instruments. Learn the basics of embedded microcontroller programming and circuit design, while crafting miniature synthesizers using a combination of electronics, programming, and art materials. For those interested, we can delve into the mysteries of FM sound generation and work on creating structed, pictorial representations of sound. No experience necessary—but you’ve got to love crafts, drawing, sound, and learning new ways of making electronics.

### Surveys
For our ongoing research at [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) and my own thesis, there is a pre-and-post workshop survey that should be filled out:

### TinyProgrammer

- TinyProgrammer ([SparkFun](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11460))

The TinyProgrammer is a sweet little tool that vastly simplifies the programming of Atmel's ATTiny45/85 microcontrollers. The 'tinys', as they're affectionately called, can do just about everything an Arduino can do (Atmel makes the ATmega168/32U4), but are much cheaper, smaller, and for our purposes--much more easily embedded. [David Mellis](http://media.mit.edu/~mellis) designed this one.

### Paper Speakers

I've written up the basics, gleaned from many-a-resource, in a post, here: 

- [Speakers Paperish](http://localhost:8080/posts/2013/4/1/speaker-paperish)

[Hannah Perner-Wilson](http://plusea.at), as always, is a one-woman army. She has done a variety of gorgeous pieces:

- [Paper Speaker Tutorial](http://hlt.media.mit.edu/?p=1372) on the High-Low Tech Site 
- [Sea-shell Headphones](http://www.plusea.at/?p=4596)

[Marcelo Coelho](http://www.cmarcelo.com/#/pulp-based-computing/) put together some particularly striking, insprirational examples, if a bit more involved than what we'll be making.

### Helpful Information
- [Bare Conductive's Paper Battery Holder](http://www.bareconductive.com/paper-battery-holders)

A really nice collection of elegant folded designs. Incorporating power into paper electronic projects has long been tricky, and these are some nice solutions. We've long-used a binder clip and a coin-cell battery, which works pretty well too.  

- [ATTiny Datasheet](http://www.atmel.com/Images/Atmel-2586-AVR-8-bit-Microcontroller-ATtiny25-ATtiny45-ATtiny85_Datasheet.pdf) 

This is not really that useful--a hundred-odd pages of technical specifications. But it's interesting if you want to delve deeper into how people actually _understand_ these things. And the pin diagram is on the second page.
