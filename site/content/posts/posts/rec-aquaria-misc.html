I've been returning to aquariums with a force, lately, rigging-up a new set-up with a couple of neon tetras and a dozen-odd cherry chrimp that I picked up from Ebay.{{ macros.render_footnote("shrimps-1", "1")}} I got started with aquariums years ago, in elementary school--I don't recall why, exactly--but perhaps it had something to do with growing up by [Allan's Aquarium][allan], one of the finest fish stores around.  

At any rate, with aquariums on the mind, I dredged up my very first forays onto the _Internet_. These are gems from the `rec.aquaria` usenet, now archived on Google Groups. I remember posting these, sitting on my dad's lap on the dial-up that we had from UCLA. 

Here's a sample, posted in September of 1996:
