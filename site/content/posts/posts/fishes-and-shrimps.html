*This is a about fish & shrimps.*

As I've evidenced [previously](/posts/2013/1/10/rec-aquaria-misc/), I've been an "aquarist" since I was just a turquoise-sweat-shirt-wearing lad. I remember packing some antiquated copy of a "Guide to Tropical Fishes" in my blue Jansport for bus-ride perusing. Those years were formative. I seemed precociously brilliant, then, pouring myself into eccentric, monkish activities{{ macros.footnote_render("1", "tooth-1") }}--but I was on the eve of being swept away by the generic interests of adolescence--video games, skateboards, girls. My undoing.

At any rate, my fish tanks had run their course by the time I'd gotten into middle school, when all that remained of a once-teeming menagerie was a stately marbled angelfish who must've been, I don't know, seven or eight years old.

Returning to aquariums in my quasi-adulthood
, with all the accompanying resources, has been gratifying, and I've put together a much more graceful aquarium than I've ever had. I don't quite know where the aquarium habit began or maybe I do, my grandfather had a tank, I know that. And my father, now, for years has had a small, suntank perched on his windowsill, but I don't think that I was ever prodded into aquatic-ownership.
