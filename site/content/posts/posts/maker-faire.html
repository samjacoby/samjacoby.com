### Open Source Hardware Summit
Recuperating this week from a grand time in New York City. We converged on its gray shores last week to stop by the [Open Source Hardware Summit](http://summit.oshwa.org/), where people vaguely gesticulated in the direction of "open source" and show-cased their projects. The good men (and they are that) of [Industry City Distillery](http://drinkicd.com) were there, handing out thimbles of vodka.

### World MakerFaire NYC 2012
On Saturday I made the sojourn out to Flushing. I'll reserve the tale of our trevails on the MTA for another day--suffice it to say, it took two-and-half hours to stumble out to the hinterlands of Queens and I barely arrived in time for a workshop on conductive ink with [Analisa Russo](http://colloids.matse.illinois.edu/group.html), who'd brought a number of her pen-on-paper conductive silver pens ([video][1]) to play with.  

I was racing about, so didn't get a chance to snap many photos--but things turned out nicely. Many thanks to AnnMarie Thomas and the [Maker Ed](http://makered.org) team for making it happen!
