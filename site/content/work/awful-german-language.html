Learning German is hard. Twain got that like no other. This essay, originally an appendix in _The Tramps Abroad_, details his trials and trevails of trying to master _deutsch_, and was a great solace to me while attempting to do the same. 

Printed at the _Druckladen_ of the Gutenberg Museum, in Mainz, Germany, making use of some of the unusual typefaces in their extensive collection.
