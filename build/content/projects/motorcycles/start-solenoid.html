## Starter Solenoid
Online, a number of people suggest checking out your starter solenoid to make sure that it's routing current to the starter, correctly.

My solenoid wasn't all that dirty and it seemed to be working correctly. I could hear the click of it firing when I hit the ignition--but I didn't know much about how it worked or whether the contacts themselves were making a good enough connection.

I cleaned it up some and then ran some tests with a bench-top supply at work. Draws a fair bit of current to trigger, which makes sense. It's a beefy little unit. Of course, I also looked on Ebay where new replacement solenoids are being sold for like $8, but restoring them is more fun.
