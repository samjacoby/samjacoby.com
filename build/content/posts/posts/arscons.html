## Arch Linux & Thinkpad X40: A love story

{% mark excerpt %}
I've used Arch Linux for years -- always a bit ineptly, I must admit -- and a while back, mostly because of a new job (and the allure of ditching my open-source sensibilities and using Adobe CS), I switched to a Mac. I've been happy enough, but there's something about coding in Snow Leopard or Lion or Cat or whatever we're on, that I've never really liked. Too slick, maybe. I find I work better in heavily constrained environments. 
{% endmark %}

So I've always had another machine around for my "real" coding work. That lot falls to an old Thinkpad X40 that I hauled around on a six-month jaunt in Nicaragua, when I was taking some time off from college and working for [The Tico Times](http://ticotimes.net). I was running Ubuntu then. It was like a rock--it's still going strong. Over the years, I've amassed a small armada of X40s: you can get one in working-order on [Ebay](http://www.ebay.com/sch/Laptops-Netbooks-/175672/i.html?_nkw=x40%20thinkpad&_mPrRngCbx=1&_udlo=10&_udhi=76) for under $65 bucks. How can you resist?

## Arch + Arduino 

On my latest X40, I'm running Arch off've a charming 4GB USB stick (the X40s on Ebay are almost always stripped of their hard-drives). It's a little pokey, particularly on writing to disk, but I couldn't be happier. And my little, cranky, skull-bucket of a Thinkpad feels as roomy as the glossy 13" MacBook Pro I usually work and the keyboard has none of the mushy play. (Read up on Mako's [great post](http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/20111207-00) on the great swindle that is the 16:9 screen ratio -- which is why the X40 _is_ actually as large as the MBP).

At any rate, all of that doesn't change the fact that it's an antiquated machine and I use it primarily for text editing. Not much else. I like coding on it--there's no electro-peace like a tiling windows manager (Awesome) and someone else's fantastic .vimrc. 

I've been using [Brian Mayton's](http://bdm.cc) Makefile ([file](https://github.com/samjacoby/avr/blob/master/makefiles.templates/avr_makefile_brian)) to compile my avr programs--but honestly, I love the convenience of the Arduino libraries and all the rest, even if they're anathema to Assembly Cowboys. 

Not growing up on embedded programming, the whole `(1 << PB4)`, alas, does not quite feel like first nature. One sore spot has been the Arduino IDE, which in all its muscular Java-ness, is a bit much for the X40 to handle. 

So--how do you use the Arduino libraries in the comfort of your own `vim` config? There are a couple of ways. I use [Arscons](https://github.com/suapapa/arscons), a python build script, that makes the process relatively painless. 

First, install the necessaries: 

    sudo pacman -S install python-pyserial scons  

Then grab the [SConstruct](https://github.com/suapapa/arscons) file and copy it into your sketch folder. Run `scons`, and let the magic unfold. Maybe. Didn't work for me outt've the box. Because I have several versions of avr-gcc, a conflict prevented programs from compiling correctly. I edited the SConstruct file to make it work right--in my case, I just modified the `AVR_BIN_PREFIX` setting to point to the actual Arduino install of `avr-gcc`. That broke `avrdude`, but such is life. I don't know exactly what was amiss, but it seemed to have worked fine.
    
So that's that--not so grand. Scons is basically Make--or does the same things, at least--and lets you use Python rather than all of that gibberish. There *are* `Makefiles` for Arduino that do the exact same thing--but they are even more of a code soup.  

**UPDATE:** I checked in with Dave and Arduino ships with its own version of avr-gcc with a number of necessary tweaks.

**NOTE:** Yes, yes, I know I can use an external editor with Arduino, but I don't like doing that for some reason. I end up being confused about where I should be editing.
