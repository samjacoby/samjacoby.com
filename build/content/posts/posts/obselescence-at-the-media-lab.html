In some sense, the Media Lab has won. We're awash in technology. We're wired, linked-up, friended, connected, squeezed, looped, trundled, sphinctered, and whatever else. The most ambitious visions of the Media Lab, when it was laid out in  

A network made of personal ties works only so-far. Joi, the lab director, has pushed such practices out to their logical extreme. He has several thousand facebook friends, a vast Twitter following, and legions of  

You can see this in the kind of faculty the lab is beginning to accrue: brilliant, but conventional scientists like Ed Boyden, who bring large governement grants and legions of graduate students to bear on supernaturally-diffucult problems. That's not to say that such work doesn't have a place at the Media Lab--it certainly does--but it doesn't _need_ the Media Lab. If not here, Boyden would be doing his work at Harvard, or Stanford, or Princeton, or any other such august insitution.  

Faculty who do come here are increasingly from the private sector. And why not? If you're academically rigorous, you can find a berth elsewhere. 

And if you're not--if you're just making cool shit, say--what do you need the lab for? You've got KickStarter, you've got eBay, you've got a half-dozen-odd major forums to share your work with others. 

So why are you at the lab? You might need the paycheck. You might be in it, simply for the grandeur, the MIT brand, but why else? And I think that's essentially something that's been reflected here. 
If you're not--KickStarter, start-up incubators, and dozens of other forums provide ample resources. So what does the Media Lab add, really? One could argue that nowhere else is there such a heady-mix of diverse and fascinating faculty members. Remember the famous collaboration between Pattie Maes and Hiroshi Ishii? Or that gorgeous integration of bioengineering--the optogenetics of Ed Boyden meet the biologically-inspired structures of Neri Oxman?
