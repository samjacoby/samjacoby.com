*This is about fish, shrimps, and plants.*

As I've discussed [(req.aquaria.misc)](/posts/2013/1/10/rec-aquaria-misc/), I've been an "aquarist" since I was a sweatshirt-wearing lad. In elementary school, I remember packing some antiquated copy of a "Guide to Tropical Fishes" in my blue Jansport for bus-ride perusing. I don't remember bringing much else. Those years were formative. I seemed precociously brilliant, then, pouring myself into eccentric, monkish activities--but I was on the eve of being swept away by the generic interests of adolescence--video games, skateboards, girls. My undoing.{{ macros.render_footnote("tooth", "1") }} 

At any rate, my fish tanks had run their course by the time I'd gotten into middle school, when all that remained of a once-teeming menagerie was a stately-marbled angelfish who must've been, I don't know, seven or eight years old by then. Having mothered a dozen generations of small-fry and outlived the molly's and swordtails (not to mention her mate), she patrolled the tank, an aging matriarch.

### The Tanks

I threw up some pictures on Flickr. I thought it might be worth describing my set-up, not because it's so extraordinary. I've got three tanks going, now, which have gone through a number of different iterations:

1. 2.5 gallon metaframe, sludge from a pond off've the Minuteman Trail

This little tank is gem. I've got an eBay search going on these metaframe tanks. Sometimes they go for a song. This one was like ten bucks or something--and watertight! It's been seeded with nothing but a little water from a pond out by Davis Square.{{ macros.render_footnote("aquaria", "1") }}  

2. 2.5 gallon, sludge
3. 20 gallon, fish, shrimps, & plants, C02, light

[Daniel Leithinger](http://www.leithinger.net){{ macros.render_footnote("daniel", "2") }} introduced me to Diane Walstead's excellent, if eccentric, [Ecology of the Planted Aquarium](http://www.atlasbooks.com/marktplc/00388.htm), a fairly dense compendium of charts and such, analyzing the relationship between soil and light and iron levels and many other tedious things. Nonetheless, it's useful and I've used her advice in conmtrolling algea and fertilizing the plants that I've got going--it's worked well, so I shouldn't be so snippy.{{ macros.render_footnote("walstad", "3") }} 


{{ macros.render_footnote("tooth-1","1", "I was also a diligent architect of toothpick planes and boats. Evidence to all-concerned of early genius.") }}
{{ macros.render_footnote("fish-1", "2", "Check out his [gorgeous planted tank](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hLBGs4_A1Z0&feature=youtu.be). Another level.") }}
{{ macros.render_footnote("walstad", "3", "I point you in particular to [Small Planted Tanks for Pet Shrimp](http://www.atlasbooks.com/marktplc/00388Shrimp.pdf), a monograph particularly close to my heart.") }}
{{ macros.render_footnote("aquaria", "1", "I'm sure it's been adulterated with something or other from the other tanks, as I've shared equipment between all of them.") }}  

<!--
Returning to aquariums in my quasi-adulthood
, with all the accompanying resources, has been gratifying, and I've put together a much more graceful aquarium than I've ever had. I don't quite know where the aquarium habit began or maybe I do, my grandfather had a tank, I know that. And my father, now, for years has had a small, suntank perched on his windowsill, but I don't think that I was ever prodded into aquatic-ownership.
