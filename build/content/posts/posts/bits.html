Make this the first line of your Python script "#!/usr/bin/env python"
Change the extension of the script file to ".command" i.e. my_python_script.command
In Terminal make the Python script file executable by running "chmod +x my_python_script.command"
Now when you double click the Python script in Finder it will open a terminal window and run.
