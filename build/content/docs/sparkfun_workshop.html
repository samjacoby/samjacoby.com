# Drawing the Electric Synth 
#
## Class Description
We'll explore conductive inks and other materials to create unique, interactive musical instruments. Learn the basics of embedded microcontroller programming and circuit design, while crafting miniature synthesizers using a combination of electronics, programming, and art materials. For those interested, we can delve into the mysteries of FM sound generation and work on creating structed, pictorial representations of sound. No experience necessary--but you've got to love crafts, drawing, sound, and learning new ways of making electronics.

# Make a Game Controller 
## Class Description
We'll use conductive materials to create custom game controllers for PC applications. Using conductive inks and graphite, we'll work with different layouts and interface formats, as well as the signal-processing behind them, to make sliders, wheels, and touchpads to control generic applications. Experiment with different forms of capacitive sensing and explore the possibilities presented by hand-drawn electrodes on a variety of surfaces.
