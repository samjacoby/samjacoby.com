I'm a printer and programmer in New York City. I work at The New York Times. 

You can find me on [github][0] & [twitter][1].  

Here's my [resume]({{ media_url('files/resume.pdf')}}), and a site where I very infrequently [sell my books][3]. 

In 2013, I graduated from the [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) Research Group at the [MIT Media Lab](http://media.mit.edu), where I worked with paper and conductive inks. After that, I worked for [Formlabs](http://formlabs.com), a 3D-printing start-up. 

I graduated from Harvard in 2009, where I studied computer science and history. 

My email address is sam@shackmanpress.com. My PGP fingerprint is 6158 7468 4027 7C94 0083  E78B CB8F 3E72 9477 5FF1. My full public key is [here][4].
