<p>In 1860, Charle's Darwin had a bad day:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am very poorly today &amp; very stupid &amp; hate everybody &amp; everything. One lives only to make blunders. </p>
<p>I am going to write a little Book for Murray on orchids &amp; today I hate them worse than everything. </p>
<p><span style="font-style: normal">Charles Darwin, Letter to Charles Lytrell, 1860</span></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This broadside serves to inspire </p>
<p>Darwin's grumpy <a href="http://www.npr.org/blogs/krulwich/2012/10/18/163181524/charles-darwin-and-the-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-day">letter</a> to friend seemed inspiring enough to justify a broadside that I put together in the bosom of winter in 2014.  </p>
<p>Poor fellow, he hates them worse than <em>anything</em>! </p>
