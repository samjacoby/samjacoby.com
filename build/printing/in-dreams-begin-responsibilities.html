        <p>The first time I read Delmore Schwartz&#8217;s classic, &#8220;In Dreams Begin Responsibilities,&#8221; I felt like I&#8217;d been clubbed in the head. So simple, so lucid, so precise. It&#8217;s an antidote to a kind of foggy-minded adolescent angst that a lot of short stories (especially by young people) trend towards&#8212;certainly any of my own efforts. He&#8217;s got some other great ones in the collection of the same title, too, &#8220;America, America!&#8221; I maybe should&#8217;ve printed that one&#8212;actually, definitely should&#8217;ve. Anyhow, read&nbsp;it.  </p>
<p>This project took a while to get going. For one, the story is still under copyright. <a href="http://ndbooks.com/book/in-dreams-begin-responsibilities-other-stories">New Directions</a> graciously gave me permission to reprint it. Such permission isn&#8217;t always forthcoming. (I tried getting in touch with Bruno Schulz&#8217;s estate at some point to see about printing some of his work, but I didn&#8217;t have much&nbsp;luck.) </p>
<p>I worked with <a href="http://linnmeyers.com/">Linn Meyers</a>, who furnished the fantastic images, and <a href="http://morrisdickstein.com/">Morris Dickstein</a>, who wrote a thoughtful afterword about Schwartz. Dickstein published his <a href="http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-arts-and-culture/books/74715/growing-pains">afterword in Tablet</a>, if you&#8217;d like to take a look there. Initially, I also got in touch with Lou Reed (or at least, his agency), but I didn&#8217;t make a whole lot of progress. Then I saw the new <a href="http://ndbooks.com/">New Directions</a> edition of the <a href="http://ndbooks.com/book/in-dreams-begin-responsibilities-other-stories">collected stories</a>, pretty sweet, with <em>his</em> foreword. I give myself partial&nbsp;credit. </p>
