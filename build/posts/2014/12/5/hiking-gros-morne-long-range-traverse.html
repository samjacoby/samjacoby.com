    <section>
        <p>A group of my friends periodically comes together in (increasingly) far-flung parts of the world to remind each other of our mutual affection. The most recent round took us to Newfoundland, a ragged slash of land off the Eastern coast of Canada. The ostensible object was the Long Range Traverse, a trail across the mountains that run the length of Newfoundland&#8217;s <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nl/grosmorne/index.aspx">Gros Morne National Park</a>. This was as unlikely a mission as any for this particular crew. I wouldn&#8217;t say that we&#8217;re wholly unathletic, but it&#8217;s not what springs to mind. That said, we&#8217;re all reasonably competent at  various things—from television trivia to expounding conservative ideology—so with a bit of prep (see below), it worked out. It was pretty,&nbsp;too.  </p>
<h3>Before&nbsp;Leaving</h3>
<ul>
<li>Reserve flights to <span class="caps">YDF</span>, Deer Lake. These cost a small fortune. All of our flights went through&nbsp;Toronto.  </li>
<li>Make <span class="caps">LRT</span> permit reservations with the Gros Morne park office. Another small fortune ($80 each or&nbsp;so)</li>
<li>Hotel reservations on either side. We went with the Holiday Inn Express, which was definitely the top-end of the market. That&#8217;s just how we&nbsp;roll. </li>
<li>Car rental for the duration, though it spent most of the time sitting in the trailhead parking lot. Seemed essential&nbsp;nonetheless. </li>
<li>Scheduling &#8220;taxi&#8221; drop-off at Western Brook Pond&nbsp;trailhead.</li>
<li>Getting map <span class="amp">&amp;</span> <span class="caps">GPS</span> waypoints (I actually didn&#8217;t see these for sale at the welcome center, but could&#8217;ve missed&nbsp;them).</li>
<li>Reserving ferry tickets to be dropped off at trailhead. Actually, not sure if these were reserved. Jesse definitely checked the times&nbsp;though. </li>
</ul>
<p>That was about it, I believe. I didn&#8217;t do any of this. I mostly confined myself to perusing various online travel guides and figuring out how to use a little <span class="caps">GPS</span> gadget I&#8217;d purchased for the occasion. After some wrangling, I managed to load on the free <a href="http://www.ibycus.com/ibycustopo/">Ibycus Topo Maps</a>, that provide detailed coverage of all of Canada. For those new to the world of <span class="caps">GPS</span> devices and the like, it&#8217;s a pain—a network of proprietary devices and file formats, custom-made tools for conversions, well-intentioned corporate efforts at cross compatibility, etc. For good measure, I also ordered the necessary (paper) topo map as a fall-back&nbsp;(012H12-P). </p>
<p><em>Note: all of the photos here are courtesy of my dear friend Anton, who among his many talents, is a fantastic photographer. Thanks,&nbsp;Anton!</em> </p>
<h2>Day 0: Getting&nbsp;Set</h2>
<p>We assembled at Deer Lake, where the airport is, but that&#8217;s a solid hour or so from Gros Morne itself. Joe&#8217;s flight was delayed, which made it mildly more complex. And there was some kind of elaborate blasting operation taking place on the single road to Grose Morne, so we ended up arriving at the visitor center towards the end of the day. I don&#8217;t know why I thought it&#8217;d be less developed, but it was one of those solid, rustic buildings with carpet and bits of antler and&nbsp;everything. </p>

</figure>

<p>After announcing that we had reservations for the <span class="caps">LRT</span>, we were directed over to a sunken auditorium, where a somber video introduced us to the trail. This was the first indication that thing wouldn&#8217;t be quite as rugged as anticipated. How many trails have full-blown taped&nbsp;introductions?    </p>
<h3>The&nbsp;Test</h3>
<p>To get issued tickets for the <span class="caps">LRT</span>, you&#8217;ve got to pass a written basic wilderness navigation exam. We were all a bit nervous about this, having essentially zero experience. The internet had various rumblings about it; it didn&#8217;t <em>seem</em> difficult, but some hikers had been delayed while trying to convince the rugged characters up there that they were fit to take the trail. That, and the standard issue emergency <span class="caps">GPS</span> beacon that everyone is issued gave the endeavour a serious, dramatic&nbsp;air. </p>
<figure class="with-caption">

    <figcaption><p>Great minds assemble (this photo, and every other, courtesy of Anton&nbsp;Troianovski).</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Navigation-wise, after watching a few YouTube videos and trying to wrap my mind around declination and such, I felt reasonably prepared. We needn&#8217;t of worried. The test itself is only 20 or so questions, a few typewritten sheets: take various readings off of a map, identify where you might read the scale, measure the declination,  grade-school stuff. While I&#8217;d imagined we&#8217;d be in a room with a stern, weathered Canadian outdoorsman, the whole affair was much more casual. We got to take the test off to a table in the visitor center and work together as a group. And the particular photocopy we&#8217;d been issued happened to have the answer key stapled to the reverse. Oops. I pointed this out to the rangers when we returned it to the desk, so I imagine that particularly oversight has been corrected (sorry), but overall, it wasn&#8217;t a big&nbsp;deal.  </p>
<p>We passed with flying colors, though I&#8217;ll admit, that doesn&#8217;t prove much. And it seemed like we had a better sense of some of the answers than the ranger. Passed, <span class="caps">OK</span>. But I wasn&#8217;t exactly sure how we were going to cope on the&nbsp;trail.   </p>
<p>After a solid dinner at Earle&#8217;s (at least I thought so)—Moose Burgers, Peanut Butter milkshakes, and other assorted Newfie delicacies—and we spent the night at a campground that Anton had scoped out, Green Point, just north of&nbsp;town. </p>
<figure class="with-caption">

<p>It was a nice, developed campground. We got there a bit late in the day to really enjoy the beach, but it was a beautiful spot. We divied up some supplies, food, etc., in the back of our rented minivan. I, of course, was stressed about the relative weight distribution, as well as the self-appointed navigator dude, somewhat apprehensive about the&nbsp;&#8216;morrow. </p>
<h2>Day 1: We&nbsp;Begin</h2>
<p>We drove out to the end-point of the <span class="caps">LRT</span>, which is just a few minutes from the visitors center. Most people do it this way—North to South—and were met there by a pair of friendly locals who moonlight a &#8220;taxi&#8221; service. Jesse made the reservations, I think, so I don&#8217;t recall the exact details. I do know that one of the fellows ran Pittman&#8217;s Restarurant in Norris Point. Or maybe Pittman&#8217;s Inn in Rock Harbor. Something like&nbsp;that. </p>
<p>They charged, I believe, $20 each, which like most things in Newfoundland, seemed a bit steep, but what-the-hey. Anyhow, the system worked well enough. We piled in and they drove us up to Western Brook Pond, where we&#8217;d been instructed to begin the trip. The Pond is a capped fjord, a long jet of water between steep cliffs. After being dropped off by our drivers (who gamely snapped our photo), we walked the mile-or-two of boardwalk that spans the swamp between the coast and the pond. Upon arrival, we encountered our first mini fiasco: a gruff, intimidating ship captain, who eyeing our packs, informed us that we&#8217;d screwed up—the 11:30 ferry was too big to stop at the small dock that we&#8217;d have to be dropped off at: we were supposed to be on the small boat that only left at&nbsp;9:<span class="caps">00AM</span>.  </p>
<p>Jesse, our planner-in-chief, was disconsolate. He&#8217;d called and asked this very question, and the woman he spoke to had insisted just the opposite. Nevertheless, despite the warning, the boat boss said &#8220;he&#8217;d do his best to drop us off,&#8221; leaving off with a significant shrug. What would happen if we didn&#8217;t manage to get to the trailhead wasn&#8217;t immediately clear. No matter; we bought our tickets—$33 dollars apiece. We&#8217;d cleverly left our credit cards behind in the car (what kind&#8217;ve backwoods adventurer carries plastic?) so in another panicked moment, we pooled our emergency cash reserves and came up with the request $<span class="caps">200CAD</span> or so. Off we went! Every place we went too was happy to take <span class="caps">USD</span> (along with the favorable exchange&nbsp;rate).  </p>
<p>The weather was great and the ferry ride was lovely. Concern over the drop-off gradually dissipated. It seemed clear that there was some element of manly psuedo-drama in the captain&#8217;s warning: we&#8217;d met a trio of hikers who&#8217;d be starting down the trail with us who were in the same situation. We also met another fellow from Somerville, <span class="caps">MA</span> (Union Square, actually), on some intermediary leg of a vast cross-continental tour (and from whom Mishy immediately extracted various personal details—&#8221;Will you and your girlfriend get married?&#8221;&nbsp;Maybe.) </p>

</figure>

<p>The drop-off wasn&#8217;t anything to worry about after all. The captain brought the boat around slowly, and though they didn&#8217;t tie down, we easily stepped off on to the dock. We paused there for a moment, and after getting our bearings and clicking &#8220;go&#8221; on the <span class="caps">GPS</span>, set off. A very clearly marked trail led us up the gorge, through thick, almost tropical growth. As we ascended the gorge, the path become somewhat less clear—but it was tough to get lost. The gorge was narrow, and well, we were just going up&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Just a few miles from the trailhead, this was, funnily enough, where we go the most lost—or at least, half of us did. Time and again, we&#8217;d been told to &#8220;go right&#8221; at the waterfall. We kept our eyes peeled. When the opportunity presented itself, it was pretty clear what right was — a sheet of water slid across the center of the gorge. To left was a reasonably-sheer cliff. We went right. Too far right, it turns out. Mishy, Joe, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> I found ourselves gnarled in a thick nest of tuckamore — the technical term for wiry, nearly-impassable scrub of stunted trees that was a fixture of the&nbsp;trip. </p>

    <figcaption><p>Looking back at Western Brook&nbsp;Pond</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We weren&#8217;t lost, per se, just a little off the trail. It wasn&#8217;t pleasant. Hacking through the thick scrub hurts. I picked some scratches or bites or something, that I ended up carrying fora couple of weeks after. At length, we made it back to the trail, rejoining our merry fellows. So challenges, we decided to camp in the bowl at the top of the gorge—which after a group photo, clouded in. We cooked and made camp, bracing ourselves for the poor weather we knew was to&nbsp;come.  </p>

<h2>Day 2: We&nbsp;Endure</h2>
<p>We woke in the fog. It was cold and wet, though not yet rainy. That would come later. This was the worst day. It was  about as close as I&#8217;ve gotten to a bit of a &#8220;situation&#8221;, but I&#8217;m also a little paranoid. We did seem to be on the verge of hypothermia at certain points, though&#8230;Starting out, all was rosy. It took some doing to even figure out the best route out of the bowl. We clicked around ineffectually on the <span class="caps">GPS</span>, and tried to read the wet, creased map—but we did&nbsp;fine. </p>
<p>Starting out from the top of the gorge, we were surprised by how much longer it took us to make it to the Little Island Pond campground. Good thing we decided to camp early.  We checked out what we&#8217;d been missing — wet, leaf-covered platforms and a nice, open-air toilet. The trail, in general, was very well-marked. We did refer to the map, compass, and <span class="caps">GPS</span>, but honestly, it would&#8217;ve been tough to get lost, at least in the first part of the day. We speculated that it was because it was so late in the season (mid-September), that the trail had been beaten-pretty well in. Also, no bugs. After what I&#8217;d read about black flies and the like, that was great. I don&#8217;t even think I went for my bug spray once, or the various mosquito nets I&#8217;d&nbsp;packed.  </p>

<p>After passing Little Island Pond, we pushed on to Hardings. This was the toughest stretch of the day, and probably the trip — an endless succession of water-soaked meadows, muddy pits, and stream crossings, all in an intermittent freezing rain. We did spot a few rainbows along the way, but it turned windier and the rain turned colder as the day wore on, and by the late afternoon, we were very cold and soaking wet.. I don&#8217;t think we caught more than a glimmer of sunshine all&nbsp;day. </p>

    <figcaption><p>An athletic&nbsp;moment.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>By the time we were coming descending to Hardings Pond we were miserable. At the lake&#8217;s edge, we passed the other three hikers who we were sharing the trail with. They had set-up camp against the wall of a rangers&#8217; hut—clearly closed—on the shore. It looked like they were boiling water in the outhouse. It was <em>cold</em>.  They waved us merrily on, and we trudged grimly through the mud, hoping for a sheltered camping&nbsp;spot.</p>
<figure class="with-caption">

    <figcaption><p>Soaking next to Hardings&nbsp;Pond.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Nothing to be found — the platforms on Hardings Pond are clustered along an exposed beach. Beautiful, no doubt, in fine weather. It didn&#8217;t look like it now. Mishy had started uncontrollably shivering. Joe followed. We set-up the tents side-by-side on the tent platform to create a little area screened from the wind. It kinda worked, and at least, with the tents up, we were protected from the cold. Recovery was on the&nbsp;way.  </p>
<h2>Day 3: We See a&nbsp;Moose</h2>
<p>The next morning was&nbsp;sunny.</p>
<figure class="with-caption">

</figure>

<p>As we were getting moving, the other hikers cheerfully passed us: &#8220;We were worried about you guys last night!&#8221; Yeah. Sure. What were they expecting to find? Our frigid little bodies, desperately spooning in the Gros Morne mud? At any rate, we were triumphant and so fortified by survival, forged on. Hump day. Battle legs forged, the planw as to push on, well, as far as we could. At this point, somewhat to our surprise, we&#8217;d scarely made it half-way. The blithe travelogs of the more capable taunted us, as we scrambled to make up&nbsp;time.</p>
<p>Today, I would say, was also the first real &#8220;trail-less&#8221; day. Much had been made, with the test, the emergency beacons, etc., of how there wasn&#8217;t much of a trail. That wasn&#8217;t our experience. For most of the trip, we followed a well-marked and fairly obvious trail. Along ridges, there were often cairns, and in some dense forested portions, pink-flagged ribbons marked tricky passages. In general, by West Coast standards, I&#8217;d say, this was a well-marked trail. Perhaps not like the <span class="caps">AT</span> or something, flagged by distinctive blazes or signs—but still pretty good. This day was the tricky one, as it were, but we were patient with the maps and the <span class="caps">GPS</span>, and never got too far out track. We had a few good moments of &#8220;rediscovering&#8221; the path, but nothing ever got particularly dire. We also saw a moose! A huge bull standing probably 50 yards off the trail. He moved fairly quickly off into the tuckamore, but we got a good long look. Though we saw a lot of tracks, we never saw any&nbsp;elk.  </p>

<p><img alt="" src="http://samjacoby.com/media/files/newfoundland.gif" /></p>
<p>At some point late in the afternoon, Jon&#8217;s boot disintegrated entirely. After four days of constant moisture, the rubber sole just fell off. Pretty miserable. He swapped into some crocs, but that didn&#8217;t seem much better. Wet, wet, and&nbsp;nasty. </p>
<p>Redemption came, though, in where we decided to camp that night, on a bustery cliff overlooking an astonishing&nbsp;gorge.</p>

<p>We had couscous and sausage, which was delicious (though instantly cold). Anton made some little European tea and jamm&nbsp;thing.   </p>
<h2>Day 4: A&nbsp;Return</h2>
<p>From where we&#8217;d camped, we were already on the high-plateau just north of Gros Morne itself. We had a solid hike ahead, but there wasn&#8217;t much concern that we&#8217;d be lost or not make it. I think we were all pretty ready to call it quits, though. The descent into Ferry Gulch was a little harrowing, a vertical scramble anchored by muddy roots. One of the least pleasant parts of the entire hike, really, was the walk out from under Gros Morne, which was a couple of miles on loose scree, followed by another hour or so through low, enclosed forests to the&nbsp;trailhead.   </p>

###[-Important-ish Things to do-] Before Leaving

- [-Flights-]{+Reserve flights+} to YDF, Deer [-Lake-]{+Lake. These cost a small fortune. All of our flights went through Toronto.+}
- [-Making-]{+Make+} LRT permit reservations with the Gros Morne park [-office-]
[-_-]{+office. Another small fortune ($80 each or so)+}
{+-+} Hotel reservations on either side. We went with the Holiday Inn Express, which was definitely the top-end of the[-Deer Lake-] market. [-That, of course, is-]{+That&#39;s+} just how we roll.
- Car rental for the [-duration for one-way pick-up-]{+duration, though it spent most of the time sitting in the trailhead parking lot. Seemed essential nonetheless.+}
- Scheduling &#34;taxi&#34; drop-off at Western Brook Pond {+trailhead.+}
- Getting map &amp; {+GPS+} waypoints (I actually didn&#39;t see these for sale at the welcome center, but could&#39;ve missed them).
- Reserving ferry tickets to be dropped off at trailhead. Actually, not sure if these were reserved. Jesse definitely checked the times though.

That was about it, I believe. I didn&#39;t do any of this. I mostly confined myself to perusing various online travel guides and figuring out how to use a[-fancy-] little GPS gadget I&#39;d purchased for the occasion. After [-much-]{+some+} wrangling, I managed to load on the {+free+} [Ibycus [-Top-]{+Topo+} Maps](http://www.ibycus.com/ibycustopo/), that provide detailed coverage of all of Canada. For those new to the world of GPS devices and the like, it&#39;s a pain—a network of proprietary devices and file formats, custom-made tools for conversions, well-intentioned corporate efforts at cross compatibility, etc. For good measure, I also ordered the necessary (paper) topo map as a fall-back  (012H12-P).

## Day 0: Getting Set
[-We&#39;d-]{+We+} assembled at Deer Lake, where the airport is, but that&#39;s a solid hour or so from Gros Morne itself. Joe&#39;s flight was delayed, which made it mildly more complex. And there was some kind of elaborate blasting operation taking place on the single road to Grose Morne, so we ended up arriving at the visitor center towards the end of the day. I don&#39;t know why I thought it&#39;d be [-more rustic,-]{+less developed,+} but it was one of those solid, rustic buildings with [-interpretation centers-]{+carpet and bits of antler+} and everything.

{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15837583256/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Some pre-trip pontificating. Waiting for Joe to land.&#34; ) }}

After announcing that we had reservations for the LRT, we were directed over to a [-sunken-auditorium,-]{+sunken auditorium,+} where a somber video introduced us to the trail. This was the first indication that thing wouldn&#39;t be quite as rugged as anticipated. How many trails have full-blown taped introductions?

### The Test
To get issued tickets for the LRT, you&#39;ve got to pass a written basic wilderness navigation exam. We were all a bit nervous about this, having essentially zero experience. The internet had various rumblings about it; it didn&#39;t _seem_ difficult, but some hikers had been delayed while trying to convince the rugged characters up there that they were fit to take the trail. That, and the standard issue emergency GPS beacon that everyone is issued gave the endeavour a serious, dramatic air.

{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15837588086/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Great minds assemble (this photo, and every other, courtesy of Anton Troianovski).&#34;) }}

Navigation-wise, after watching a few YouTube videos and trying to wrap my mind around declination and such, I felt reasonably prepared. We needn&#39;t of worried. The test itself is only 20 or so questions, a few typewritten sheets: take various readings off of a map, identify where you might read the scale, measure the declination,  grade-school stuff. While I&#39;d imagined we&#39;d be in a room with a [-rugged,-]{+stern, weathered+} Canadian outdoorsman, the whole affair was much more casual. We got to take the test off to a table in the visitor center and work together as a group. And the particular photocopy we&#39;d been issued happened to have the answer key stapled to the reverse. Oops. I pointed this out to the rangers when we returned it to the desk, so I imagine that particularly [-oversight&#39;s-]{+oversight has+} been corrected (sorry), but overall, it [-was-]{+wasn&#39;t+} a [-casual experience.-]{+big deal.+}

We passed with flying colors, though I&#39;ll admit, that doesn&#39;t prove much. And it seemed like we had a better sense of some of the answers than the ranger. {+Passed, OK. But+} I wasn&#39;t exactly sure {+how+} we were [-in-]{+going to cope on+} the [-clear.-]{+trail.+}

## Day 1: We Begin
We drove out to the end-point of the LRT, which is just a few minutes from the visitors center. Most people do it this way—North to South—and were met there by a pair of friendly locals who moonlight a &#34;taxi&#34; service. Jesse made the reservations, I think, so I don&#39;t recall the exact details. I do know that one of the fellows ran Pittman&#39;s Restarurant in Norris Point. Or maybe Pittman&#39;s Inn in Rock Harbor. Something like that.

They charged, I believe, $20 each, which like most things in Newfoundland, seemed a bit steep, but what-the-hey. Anyhow, the system worked [-easily-]{+well+} enough. We piled in and they drove us up to Western Brook Pond, where we&#39;d been instructed to begin the trip. The Pond is a capped fjord, a long jet of water between steep cliffs. After being dropped off by our drivers (who gamely snapped our photo), we walked[-over-] the mile-or-two of boardwalk that spans the swamp between the coast and the pond. Upon arrival, we encountered our first mini fiasco: a gruff, intimidating ship captain, {+who+} eyeing our[-swollen-] packs, informed us that we&#39;d screwed up—the 11:30 ferry was too [-large-]{+big+} to stop at the small dock that we&#39;d have to be dropped off at: we were supposed to be on the {+small boat that only left at+} 9:00AM.

[-jjjjjjj-]{+Jesse, our planner-in-chief, was disconsolate. He&#39;d called and asked this very question, and the woman he spoke to had insisted just the opposite. Nevertheless, despite the warning, the boat boss said &#34;he&#39;d do his best to drop us off,&#34; leaving off with a significant shrug. What would happen if we didn&#39;t manage to get to the trailhead wasn&#39;t immediately clear. No matter; we bought our tickets—$33 dollars apiece. We&#39;d cleverly left our credit cards behind in the car (what kind&#39;ve backwoods adventurer carries plastic?) so in another panicked moment, we pooled our emergency cash reserves and came up with the request $200CAD or so.

The drop-off wasn&#39;t anything to worry about after all. The captain brought the boat around slowly, and though they didn&#39;t tie down, we easily stepped off on to the [-doc.-]{+dock.+} We paused there for a moment, and after getting our bearings and clicking &#34;go&#34; on the GPS, set off. A very clearly marked trail led us up the gorge, through thick, almost tropical growth. As we ascended the gorge, the path become somewhat less clear—but it was tough to get lost. The gorge was narrow, and well, we were just going up it.[-We&#39;d been told a number of times &#34;to go right at the waterfall.&#34;-]

Just a few miles from the trailhead, this was, funnily enough, where we go the most lost—or at least, half of us did. Time and again, we&#39;d been told to &#34;go right&#34; at the waterfall. We kept our eyes peeled. When the opportunity presented itself, it was pretty clear what right was — a sheet of water slid across the center of the gorge. To left was a reasonably-sheer cliff. We went right. Too far right, it turns out. Mishy, Joe, &amp; I found ourselves gnarled in a thick nest of tuckamore — the technical term for wiry, nearly-impassable scrub of stunted trees that was a fixture of the trip.

Starting out [-at-]{+from+} the top of the gorge, we were surprised by how much longer it took us to make it to the Little Island Pond campground. {+Good thing we decided to camp early.+}  We checked out what we&#39;d been missing — wet, [-leave-covered-]{+leaf-covered+} platforms and a nice, open-air toilet. The trail, in general, was very well-marked. We did refer to the map, compass, and GPS, but honestly, it would&#39;ve been tough to get [-lost.-]{+lost, at least in the first part of the day.+} We speculated that it was because it was so late in the season (mid-September), that the trail had been beaten-pretty well in.

Battle legs forged, the planw as to push on, well, as far as we could. At this point, somewhat to our surprise, we&#39;d scarely made it half-way. The blithe travelogs of the more capable taunted us, as we scrambled to make up time.

Today, I would say, was also the first real &#34;trail-less&#34; day. Much had been made, with the test, the emergency beacons, etc., of how there wasn&#39;t much of a trail. That wasn&#39;t our experience. For most of the trip, we followed a well-marked and fairly obvious trail. Along ridges, there were often cairns, and in some dense forested portions, pink-flagged ribbons marked tricky passages. In general, by West Coast standards, I&#39;d say, this was a well-marked trail. Perhaps not like the AT or something, flagged by distinctive blazes or signs—but still pretty good. This day was the tricky one, as it were, but we were patient with the maps and the GPS, and never got too far out track. We had a few good moments of &#34;rediscovering&#34; the path, but nothing ever got particularly dire. {+We also saw a moose! A huge bull standing probably 50 yards off the trail. He moved fairly quickly off into the tuckamore, but we got a good long look. Though we saw a lot of tracks, we never saw any elk.+}

We did run into a dicey spot, but teamwork (and A-plus photojournalism) prevailed.

At some point late in the afternoon, Jon&#39;s boot disintegrated entirely. After four days of constant moisture, the rubber sole just fell off. Pretty miserable. He swapped into some crocs, but that didn&#39;t seem much better. Wet, wet, and nasty.

## Day 4: A Return
From where we&#39;d camped, we were already on the high-plateau just north of Gros Morne itself. We had a solid hike ahead, but there wasn&#39;t much concern that we&#39;d be lost or not make it. I think we were all pretty ready to call it quits, though. The descent into Ferry Gulch was a little harrowing, a vertical scramble anchored by muddy roots. One of the least pleasant parts of the entire hike, really, was the walk out from under Gros Morne, which was a couple of miles on {+loose scree, followed by another hour or so through low, enclosed forests to the trailhead.   +}

A group of my dear friends periodically come together in (increasingly) far-flung parts of the world to remind each other of our mutual affection. This most recent round took place in Newfoundland, a ragged thumb of land somewhere [-north-]{+well North+} or [-east-]{+East+} of most places familiar to [-you and me.-]{+myself.+} The object was the Long Range Traverse, a much-vaunted trail across the spine of mountains that run the length of [Gros Morne National Park](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nl/grosmorne/index.aspx). I think This, is must be said, was as unlikely a mission as any for this particular crew. While I wouldn&#39;t say that we&#39;re unathletic, per se, unlike some gangs of collegiate pals, joined in lusty pursuit of mountaintops and women, we were brought together over the school newspaper and such, rather than the mountaineering club. Needless to say, a few the marginally more experienced of us took it upon ourselves to organize. Briefly, this consisted of:

[-*-]{+###+} Important-ish Things to do Before Leaving[-*-]

[-- Making LRT reservations with the Gros Morne park office-]
[-- Car rental for the duration-]
[-- Scheduling &#34;taxi&#34; drop-off at Western Brook Pond-]
[-- Reserving ferry tickets to be dropped off at trailhead-]
- Flights to YDF, Deer Lake
{+- Making LRT permit reservations with the Gros Morne park office+}
{+_ Hotel reservations on either side. We went with the Holiday Inn Express, which was definitely the top-end of the Deer Lake market. That, of course, is just how we roll. +}
{+- Car rental for the duration for one-way pick-up+}
{+- Scheduling &#34;taxi&#34; drop-off at Western Brook Pond+}
{+- Getting map &amp; waypoints (I actually didn&#39;t see these for sale at the welcome center, but could&#39;ve missed them).+}
{+- Reserving ferry tickets to be dropped off at trailhead. Actually, not sure if these were reserved. Jesse definitely checked the times though.+}

That was about it, I believe. I didn&#39;t do any of this. I mostly confined myself to perusing various online travel guides and figuring out how to use a fancy little GPS gadget I&#39;d purchased for the occasion. After much wrangling, I managed to load on the [Ibycus Top Maps](http://www.ibycus.com/ibycustopo/), that provide detailed coverage of all of Canada. For those new to the world of GPS devices and the like, it&#39;s a pain—a network of proprietary devices and file formats, custom-made tools for conversions, well-intentioned corporate efforts at cross compatibility, etc. For good measure, I also ordered the necessary (paper) topo map as a fall-back  (012H12-P).

## Day 0: Getting Set
We&#39;d assembled at Deer Lake, where the airport is, but that&#39;s a solid hour or so from Gros Morne itself. Joe&#39;s flight was delayed, which made it mildly more complex. And there was some kind of elaborate blasting operation taking place on the single road to Grose Morne, so we ended up arriving at the visitor center towards the end of the day. I don&#39;t know why I thought it&#39;d be more rustic, but it was one of those solid, rustic buildings with interpretation centers and everything.

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15837583256/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Some pre-trip pontificating. Waiting for Joe to land.&#34; ) }}+}

After announcing that we had reservations for the LRT, we were directed over to a sunken-auditorium, where {+a+} somber video introduced us to the trail. This was the first indication that thing wouldn&#39;t be quite as rugged as anticipated. How many trails have full-blown taped introductions?

### The Test
To get issued tickets for the LRT, you&#39;ve got to pass a written basic wilderness navigation exam. We were all a bit nervous about this, having essentially zero experience. The internet had various rumblings about it; it didn&#39;t _seem_ difficult, but some hikers had been delayed while trying to convince the rugged characters up there that they were fit to take the trail. That, and the standard issue emergency GPS beacon that everyone is issued gave the endeavour a serious, dramatic air.

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15837588086/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Great minds assemble (this photo, and every other, courtesy of Anton Troianovski).&#34;) }}+}

Navigation-wise, after watching a few YouTube videos and trying to wrap my mind around declination and such, I felt reasonably prepared. We needn&#39;t of worried. The test itself is only 20 or so questions, a few typewritten sheets: take various readings off of a map, identify where you might read the scale, measure the declination,  grade-school stuff. While I&#39;d imagined we&#39;d be in a room with a rugged, Canadian outdoorsman, the whole affair was much more casual. We got to take the test off to a table in the visitor center and work together as a group. And the particular photocopy we&#39;d been issued happened to have the answer key stapled to the reverse. Oops. I pointed this out to the rangers when we returned it to the desk, so I imagine that particularly oversight&#39;s been corrected (sorry), but overall, it was a casual experience.

We passed with flying colors, though I&#39;ll admit, that doesn&#39;t prove much. {+And it seemed like we had a better sense of some of the answers than the ranger. I wasn&#39;t exactly sure we were in the clear.+}

After a solid dinner at Earle&#39;s (at least I thought so)—Moose Burgers and other assorted Newfie [-delicacies—we-]{+delicacies—and we+} spent the night at a campground that Anton had scoped out, Green Point, just north of town.

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15837596016/in/photostream/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Fish &amp; brewis w/ scrunchions.&#34; ) }}+}


It was a nice, developed campground. We got there a bit late in the day to really enjoy the beach, but it was a beautiful spot. We divied up some supplies, food, etc., in the back of our rented minivan. I, of course, was stressed about the relative weight distribution, as well as the self-appointed navigator dude, somewhat apprehensive about the &#39;morrow.

## Day 1: We Begin
We drove out to the end-point of the LRT, which is just a few minutes from the visitors center. Most people do it this way—North to South—and were met there by a pair of friendly locals who moonlight a &#34;taxi&#34; service. Jesse made the reservations, I think, so I don&#39;t recall the exact details. I do know that one of the fellows ran Pittman&#39;s Restarurant in Norris Point. Or maybe Pittman&#39;s Inn in Rock Harbor. Something like that.

They charged, I believe, $20 each, which like most things in Newfoundland, seemed a bit steep, but what-the-hey. Anyhow, the system worked easily enough. We piled in and they drove us up to Western Brook Pond, where we&#39;d been instructed to begin the trip. The Pond is a capped fjord, a long jet of water between steep cliffs. After being dropped off by our drivers (who gamely snapped our photo), we walked over the mile-or-two of boardwalk that spans the swamp between the coast and the pond. Upon arrival, we encountered our first mini fiasco: a gruff, intimidating ship captain, eyeing our swollen packs, informed us that we&#39;d screwed up—the 11:30 ferry was too large to stop at the small dock that we&#39;d have to be dropped off at: we were supposed to be on the 9:00AM.

{+jjjjjjj+}

Jesse, our planner-in-chief, was disconsolate. He&#39;d called and asked this very question, and the woman he spoke to had insisted just the opposite. Nevertheless, despite the warning, the boat boss said &#34;he&#39;d do his best to drop us off,&#34; leaving off with a significant shrug. What would happen if we didn&#39;t manage to get to the trailhead wasn&#39;t immediately clear. No matter; we bought our tickets—$33 dollars apiece. As we&#39;d cleverly left our credit cards behind in the car (what kind&#39;ve backwoods adventurer carries plastic?) so in another panicked moment, we pooled our emergency cash resources and came up with the request $200CAD or so. Off we went!

The weather was great and the ferry ride was lovely. Concern over the drop-off gradually dissipated. It seemed clear that there was some element of manly drama in the captain&#39;s concern: we&#39;d met a trio of other hikers who&#39;d be starting down the trail with us (and who we&#39;d run into a number of times over the course of the trip), who were in the same situation. We also met another fellow from Somerville, MA (Union Square, actually), on some intermediary leg of a vast cross-continental tour (and from whom Mishy immediately extracted various personal details—&#34;Will you and your girlfriend get married?&#34;)

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15676077580/in/photostream/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Sights!&#34;) }}+}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15675899018/in/photostream/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#39;Left to our fate at the end of Western Brook Pond.&#39;) }}+}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15677407959/in/photostream/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Setting off.&#34;) }}+}

The drop-off wasn&#39;t anything to worry [-about—and soon,-]{+about after all. The captain brought the boat around slowly, and though they didn&#39;t tie down,+} we [-were collected-]{+easily stepped off+} on {+to+} the [-ferry. After-]{+doc. We paused there for a moment, and after+} getting our bearings and clicking &#34;go&#34; on the GPS, [-we were off!-]{+set off.+} A very clearly marked trail led us up the gorge, through thick, almost tropical growth. As we ascended the gorge, the path become somewhat less clear—but it was tough to get lost. The gorge was narrow, and well, we were just going up it. We&#39;d been told a number of times &#34;to go right at the waterfall.&#34;

Just a few miles from the trailhead, this was, funnily enough, where we go the most lost—or at least, half of us did. Time and again, we&#39;d been told to &#34;go right&#34; at the waterfall. We kept our eyes peeled. When the opportunity presented itself, it was pretty clear what right was — a sheet of water slid across the center of the gorge. To left was a reasonably-sheer cliff. We went right. Too far right, it turns out. Mishy, Joe, &amp; I found ourselves gnarled in a thick nest of tuckamore — the technical term for wiry, nearly-impassable scrub of stunted trees that was a fixture of the trip.

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15243791783/in/photostream/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#39;Looking back at Western Brook Pond&#39;) }}+}

We weren&#39;t lost, per se, just a little off the trail. It wasn&#39;t pleasant. At length, we made it back to the trail. We decided to camp in the bowl at the top of the gorge—which after a group photo, clouded in. We cooked and made camp, bracing ourselves for the poor weather we knew was to come.

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;https://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/15241162424/in/photostream/player/&#34; width=&#34;800&#34; height=&#34;451&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Reading Evelyn Waugh. I know, right?&#34; )}}+}

## Day [-2-]{+2: We Endure+}
We woke in the fog. It was cold and wet, though not yet rainy—that would come later. This was the worst day, about as close as I&#39;ve gotten to a bit of a &#34;situation&#34;, but I&#39;m also a little paranoid. We did seem to be on the verge of hypothermia at certain points, though...Starting out, all was rosy. It took some doing to even figure out the best route out of the bowl, me clicking around ineffectually on the GPS, the map, wet, creased, and folded in my hands—but we did fine.

Starting out at the top of the gorge, we were surprised by how much longer it took us to make it to the Little Island Pond campground. We checked out what we&#39;d been missing — wet, leave-covered platforms and a nice, open-air toilet. The trail, in general, was very well-marked. We did refer to the map, compass, and GPS, but honestly, it would&#39;ve been tough to get lost. We speculated that it was because it was so late in the season (mid-September), that the trail had been beaten-pretty well in. Also, no bugs. After what I&#39;d read about black flies and the like, that was great. I don&#39;t even think I went for my bug spray.

After passing Little Island Pond, we pushed on to Hardings. This was the toughest stretch of the day, and probably the trip — an endless succession of water-soaked meadows, muddy pits, and stream crossings. We did spot a few rainbows along the way, but it turned winder and the rain turned colder as the day wore on, and by the late afternoon, we were freezing and soaking wet.. I don&#39;t think we caught more than a glimmer of sunshine all day.

[-By the time we were coming descending to Hardings Pond we were miserable. At the lake&#39;s edge, we passed the other three hikers who we were sharing the trail with. They had set-up camp against the wall of a rangers&#39; hut—clearly closed—on the shore. It looked like they were boiling water in the outhouse. It was _cold_.

## Day [-3-]{+3: We See a Moose+}

The next morning was sunny.

As we were getting moving, the other hikers cheerfully passed us: &#34;We were worried about you guys last night!&#34; Yeah. Sure. What were they expecting to find?

{+Today, I would say, was also the first real &#34;trail-less&#34; day. Much had been made, with the test, the emergency beacons, etc., of how there wasn&#39;t much of a trail. That wasn&#39;t our experience. For most of the trip, we followed a well-marked and fairly obvious trail. Along ridges, there were often cairns, and in some dense forested portions, pink-flagged ribbons marked tricky passages. In general, by West Coast standards, I&#39;d say, this was a well-marked trail. Perhaps not like the AT or something, flagged by distinctive blazes or signs—but still pretty good. This day was the tricky one, as it were, but we were patient with the maps and the GPS, and never got too far out track. We had a few good moments of &#34;rediscovering&#34; the path, but nothing ever got particularly dire.  +}

{+From where we&#39;d camped, we were already on the high-plateau just north of Gros Morne itself. We had a solid hike ahead, but there wasn&#39;t much concern that we&#39;d be lost or not make it. I think we were all pretty ready to call it quits, though. The descent into Ferry Gulch was a little harrowing, a vertical scramble anchored by muddy roots. One of the least pleasant parts of the entire hike, really, was the walk out from under Gros Morne, which was a couple of miles on+}

{+title: Hiking the Gros Morne Long Range Traverse +}
{+summary: In which modest men conquer modest mountains  +}
{+date: 2014-10-07 18:54:40 +}
{+---+}
{+A group of my dear friends periodically come together in (increasingly) far-flung parts of the world to remind each other of our mutual affection. This most recent round took place in Newfoundland, a ragged thumb of land somewhere north or east of most places familiar to you and me. The object was the Long Range Traverse, a much-vaunted trail across the spine of mountains that run the length of [Gros Morne National Park](http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nl/grosmorne/index.aspx). I think This, is must be said, was as unlikely a mission as any for this particular crew. While I wouldn&#39;t say that we&#39;re unathletic, per se, unlike some gangs of collegiate pals, joined in lusty pursuit of mountaintops and women, we were brought together over the school newspaper and such, rather than the mountaineering club. Needless to say, a few the marginally more experienced of us took it upon ourselves to organize. Briefly, this consisted of:+}

{+* Important-ish Things to do Before Leaving *+}

{+- Making LRT reservations with the Gros Morne park office+}
{+- Car rental for the duration+}
{+- Scheduling &#34;taxi&#34; drop-off at Western Brook Pond+}
{+- Reserving ferry tickets to be dropped off at trailhead+}
{+- Flights to YDF, Deer Lake+}

{+That was about it, I believe. I didn&#39;t do any of this. I mostly confined myself to perusing various online travel guides and figuring out how to use a fancy little GPS gadget I&#39;d purchased for the occasion. After much wrangling, I managed to load on the [Ibycus Top Maps](http://www.ibycus.com/ibycustopo/), that provide detailed coverage of all of Canada. For those new to the world of GPS devices and the like, it&#39;s a pain—a network of proprietary devices and file formats, custom-made tools for conversions, well-intentioned corporate efforts at cross compatibility, etc. For good measure, I also ordered the necessary (paper) topo map as a fall-back  (012H12-P). +}

{+## Day 0: Getting Set+}
{+We&#39;d assembled at Deer Lake, where the airport is, but that&#39;s a solid hour or so from Gros Morne itself. Joe&#39;s flight was delayed, which made it mildly more complex. And there was some kind of elaborate blasting operation taking place on the single road to Grose Morne, so we ended up arriving at the visitor center towards the end of the day. I don&#39;t know why I thought it&#39;d be more rustic, but it was one of those solid, rustic buildings with interpretation centers and everything. +}

{+After announcing that we had reservations for the LRT, we were directed over to a sunken-auditorium, where somber video introduced us to the trail. This was the first indication that thing wouldn&#39;t be quite as rugged as anticipated. How many trails have full-blown taped introductions?    +}

{+### The Test+}
{+To get issued tickets for the LRT, you&#39;ve got to pass a written basic wilderness navigation exam. We were all a bit nervous about this, having essentially zero experience. The internet had various rumblings about it; it didn&#39;t _seem_ difficult, but some hikers had been delayed while trying to convince the rugged characters up there that they were fit to take the trail. That, and the standard issue emergency GPS beacon that everyone is issued gave the endeavour a serious, dramatic air. +}

{+Navigation-wise, after watching a few YouTube videos and trying to wrap my mind around declination and such, I felt reasonably prepared. We needn&#39;t of worried. The test itself is only 20 or so questions, a few typewritten sheets: take various readings off of a map, identify where you might read the scale, measure the declination,  grade-school stuff. While I&#39;d imagined we&#39;d be in a room with a rugged, Canadian outdoorsman, the whole affair was much more casual. We got to take the test off to a table in the visitor center and work together as a group. And the particular photocopy we&#39;d been issued happened to have the answer key stapled to the reverse. Oops. I pointed this out to the rangers when we returned it to the desk, so I imagine that particularly oversight&#39;s been corrected (sorry), but overall, it was a casual experience.  +}

{+We passed with flying colors, though I&#39;ll admit, that doesn&#39;t prove much. +}

{+After a solid dinner at Earle&#39;s (at least I thought so)—Moose Burgers and other assorted Newfie delicacies—we spent the night at a campground that Anton had scoped out, Green Point, just north of town. It was a nice, developed campground. We got there a bit late in the day to really enjoy the beach, but it was a beautiful spot. We divied up some supplies, food, etc., in the back of our rented minivan. I, of course, was stressed about the relative weight distribution, as well as the self-appointed navigator dude, somewhat apprehensive about the &#39;morrow. +}

{+## Day 1: We Begin+}
{+We drove out to the end-point of the LRT, which is just a few minutes from the visitors center. Most people do it this way—North to South—and were met there by a pair of friendly locals who moonlight a &#34;taxi&#34; service. Jesse made the reservations, I think, so I don&#39;t recall the exact details. I do know that one of the fellows ran Pittman&#39;s Restarurant in Norris Point. Or maybe Pittman&#39;s Inn in Rock Harbor. Something like that. +}

{+They charged, I believe, $20 each, which like most things in Newfoundland, seemed a bit steep, but what-the-hey. Anyhow, the system worked easily enough. We piled in and they drove us up to Western Brook Pond, where we&#39;d been instructed to begin the trip. The Pond is a capped fjord, a long jet of water between steep cliffs. After being dropped off by our drivers (who gamely snapped our photo), we walked over the mile-or-two of boardwalk that spans the swamp between the coast and the pond. Upon arrival, we encountered our first mini fiasco: a gruff, intimidating ship captain, eyeing our swollen packs, informed us that we&#39;d screwed up—the 11:30 ferry was too large to stop at the small dock that we&#39;d have to be dropped off at: we were supposed to be on the 9:00AM. +}

{+Jesse, our planner-in-chief, was disconsolate. He&#39;d called and asked this very question, and the woman he spoke to had insisted just the opposite. Nevertheless, despite the warning, the boat boss said &#34;he&#39;d do his best to drop us off,&#34; leaving off with a significant shrug. What would happen if we didn&#39;t manage to get to the trailhead wasn&#39;t immediately clear. No matter; we bought our tickets—$33 dollars apiece. As we&#39;d cleverly left our credit cards behind in the car (what kind&#39;ve backwoods adventurer carries plastic?) so in another panicked moment, we pooled our emergency cash resources and came up with the request $200CAD or so. Off we went! +}

{+The weather was great and the ferry ride was lovely. Concern over the drop-off gradually dissipated. It seemed clear that there was some element of manly drama in the captain&#39;s concern: we&#39;d met a trio of other hikers who&#39;d be starting down the trail with us (and who we&#39;d run into a number of times over the course of the trip), who were in the same situation. We also met another fellow from Somerville, MA (Union Square, actually), on some intermediary leg of a vast cross-continental tour (and from whom Mishy immediately extracted various personal details—&#34;Will you and your girlfriend get married?&#34;) +}

{+The drop-off wasn&#39;t anything to worry about—and soon, we were collected on the ferry. After getting our bearings and clicking &#34;go&#34; on the GPS, we were off! A very clearly marked trail led us up the gorge, through thick, almost tropical growth. As we ascended the gorge, the path become somewhat less clear—but it was tough to get lost. The gorge was narrow, and well, we were just going up it. We&#39;d been told a number of times &#34;to go right at the waterfall.&#34; +}

{+Just a few miles from the trailhead, this was, funnily enough, where we go the most lost—or at least, half of us did. Time and again, we&#39;d been told to &#34;go right&#34; at the waterfall. We kept our eyes peeled. When the opportunity presented itself, it was pretty clear what right was — a sheet of water slid across the center of the gorge. To left was a reasonably-sheer cliff. We went right. Too far right, it turns out. Mishy, Joe, &amp; I found ourselves gnarled in a thick nest of tuckamore — the technical term for wiry, nearly-impassable scrub of stunted trees that was a fixture of the trip.+}

{+We weren&#39;t lost, per se, just a little off the trail. It wasn&#39;t pleasant. At length, we made it back to the trail. We decided to camp in the bowl at the top of the gorge—which after a group photo, clouded in. We cooked and made camp, bracing ourselves for the poor weather we knew was to come.  +}

{+## Day 2+}
{+We woke in the fog. It was cold and wet, though not yet rainy—that would come later. This was the worst day, about as close as I&#39;ve gotten to a bit of a &#34;situation&#34;, but I&#39;m also a little paranoid. We did seem to be on the verge of hypothermia at certain points, though...Starting out, all was rosy. It took some doing to even figure out the best route out of the bowl, me clicking around ineffectually on the GPS, the map, wet, creased, and folded in my hands—but we did fine. +}

{+Starting out at the top of the gorge, we were surprised by how much longer it took us to make it to the Little Island Pond campground. We checked out what we&#39;d been missing — wet, leave-covered platforms and a nice, open-air toilet. The trail, in general, was very well-marked. We did refer to the map, compass, and GPS, but honestly, it would&#39;ve been tough to get lost. We speculated that it was because it was so late in the season (mid-September), that the trail had been beaten-pretty well in. Also, no bugs. After what I&#39;d read about black flies and the like, that was great. I don&#39;t even think I went for my bug spray.   +}

{+After passing Little Island Pond, we pushed on to Hardings. This was the toughest stretch of the day, and probably the trip — an endless succession of water-soaked meadows, muddy pits, and stream crossings. We did spot a few rainbows along the way, but it turned winder and the rain turned colder as the day wore on, and by the late afternoon, we were freezing and soaking wet.. I don&#39;t think we caught more than a glimmer of sunshine all day. By the time we were coming descending to Hardings Pond we were miserable. At the lake&#39;s edge, we passed the other three hikers who we were sharing the trail with. They had set-up camp against the wall of a rangers&#39; hut—clearly closed—on the shore. It looked like they were boiling water in the outhouse. It was _cold_.  They waved us merrily on, and trudged grimly thorugh the mud, hoping for a sheltered camping spot.+}

{+Nothing to be found — the platforms on Hardings Lake are clustered along an exposed beach. Beautiful, no doubt, in fine weather. It didn&#39;t look like it now. Mishy had started uncontrollably shivering. Joe followed. We set-up the tents side-by-side on the tent platform to create a little area screened from the wind. It kinda worked, and at least, with the tents up, we were protected from the cold. Recovery was on the way.  +}

{+## Day 3+}

{+The next morning was sunny.+}

{+As we were getting moving, the other hikers cheerfully passed us: &#34;We were worried about you guys last night!&#34; Yeah. Sure. What were they expecting to find? Our frigid little bodies, desperately spooning in the Gros Morne mud? At any rate, we were triumphant and so fortified by survival, forged on.  +}
