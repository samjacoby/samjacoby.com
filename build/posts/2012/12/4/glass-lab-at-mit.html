</figure>

<p>Anyhow, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/glasslab/peeps_pbhouk.html">Peter Houk</a> presented some of his work to <a href="http://hlt.media.mit.edu">High-Low Tech</a> a couple of months ago&#8212;and then invited us back over to his place to experiment with some new software that <a href="http://virtualglass.org/team.html">Erik Demaine</a>, among others, have been working on. It&#8217;s called <a href="http://virtualglass.org">Virtual Glass</a>, essentially a <span class="caps">CAD</span> tool that lets you experiment with different configurations of <em>cane</em> (colored glass rods) and see how the cane will appear once pulled. I don&#8217;t know if &#8220;pulled&#8221; is the technical term, but that&#8217;s what it seemed like to me. Making glass has a lot in common with pulling taffy and baking&#8212;at least in these early&nbsp;stages.</p>
<figure class="with-caption">

    <figcaption><p>White and red cane&#8212;probably six-or-eight inches long&#8212;awaiting a pick-up on a glass&nbsp;plug.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Erik gave us a quick demo&#8212;though the software is fairly self-explanatory, especially after you&#8217;ve seen the cane made&#8212;and we came up with a number of designs of varying degrees of practicality. The point, really, was to push the designs as far as we could go&#8212;and see what kind of things Peter, Marty, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Erik could put together. This is what I came up&nbsp;with: </p>
<p>Peter was pushing us to make &#8216;unconventional&#8217; designs, as the last innovations in cane configurations were by an Italian dentist a half-century ago. It&#8217;s harder than it might seem. Because the hot glass is twisted as it is pulled into cane, patterns converge very quickly on helices, no matter how loopy your layout. The only real tool you have, then, as a designer, is the distance of each color each color from the&nbsp;center. </p>

    <figcaption><p>The <a href="http://virtualglass.org">Virtual Glass</a> software and my squiggly&nbsp;design.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>When a piece of hot glass is pulled out and spun&#8212;I&#8217;m sure this process has a lovely Italian name that I don&#8217;t know&#8212;the colors are stretched in concordance to how far they are from the center. Colors near the center of the cane show hardly any rotation at all&#8212;a vague waver, maybe. Those towards the edge wrap around dramatically, pulled around the entire circumference. In using a spiral design, the distance of the various canes from the center of the larger cane varied in a way that seemed pretty&nbsp;cool. </p>

    <figcaption><p>Fearsome flame&nbsp;fires.</p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>At any rate, Team Glass Lab decided to make it happen. There was only about a half-hour, so time was tight. It was quite a show. In corner one, we&#8217;ve got dual furnaces, each heating a white-hot pool of glass. In corner two, a glory-hole, an insanely-hot furnace in which dabs of glass are reheated and heated when on the end of an uh&#8230;punty? I may have made that term up&#8212;a long metal rod, at any rate. A blowtorch is off in the corner, braying its firey mess. (For some additional anthropological thoughts on the subject, please see: <em><a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scasss.uu.se%2FIIS2005%2Ftotal_webb%2Ftot_html%2Fpapers%2Fembodied_knowledge.pdf&amp;ei=mR7CUPSeOLGG0QHL0IHICA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEurTuRIijIgxjSkvYBr88V9uoA7g&amp;sig2=OtTGICr3kqIYG77wUhMrdQ">Conner, Erin, Embodied Knowledge in Glassblowing: the experience of meaning and the struggle towards proficiency</a></em>. I read this paper for a class on qualitative ethnography last year. Smutty&nbsp;stuff.) </p>

</figure>

<p>Watching Peter, Eric, <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Marty work was impressive. They zipped around, waving flaming gobs of glass, while we gawked and generally got in the way. In the end, they managed to make the design that we came up with. It was intricate, involving bonding together several different pieces of cane in a variety of ways, and then dousing the resultant mess in yet more glass. Something like making an elaborate, deadly,&nbsp;pastry. </p>
<p>I really wish this was in focus, but alas. This is molten glass being stretched out. Peter&#8217;s on one end, Marty the other. By the time it hardened, they&#8217;d gotten it up to probably 30 feet&nbsp;long. </p>

    <figcaption><p>The cane being pulled. You can see the dyes in the glass radiating their&nbsp;heat.</p></figcaption>

<p>The finished cane came out pretty cool too, though I think, more subtle than we had hoped. This is part of the end, that they let me take home after it had annealed. The finished cane&#8212;even, pencil-long sticks&#8212;will be used in blowing a larger, finished&nbsp;piece.  </p>

Anyhow, [Peter Houk](http://web.mit.edu/glasslab/peeps_pbhouk.html) presented some of his work to [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) a couple of months ago--and then invited us back over to his place to experiment with some new software that [Erik Demaine](http://virtualglass.org/team.html), among others, have been working on. It&#39;s called [Virtual Glass](http://virtualglass.org), essentially a CAD tool that lets you experiment with different configurations of _cane_ (colored glass rods) and see how the cane will appear once pulled. I don&#39;t know if &#34;pulled&#34; is the technical term, but that&#39;s what it seemed like to me. Making glass has a lot in common with pulling taffy and baking--at least in these early stages.

{+title: A Visit to the MIT Glass Lab+}
{+summary: High-Low Tech goes on a field trip+}
{+date: 2012-12-04 17:05:59+}
{+---+}
{+A venture-some crew headed off the [MIT Glass Lab](http://web.mit.edu/glasslab/). In the basement, off&#39;ve of the Infinite--or more accurately, perhaps, directly below the Infinite. An odd corner of things--I&#39;d assumed that it was a hold-over from the days when chemistry departments blew their own glass and the like. It&#39;s in the materials science department, I believe. So it goes.+}

{+Anyhow, [Peter Houk](http://web.mit.edu/glasslab/peeps_pbhouk.html) presented some of the Glass Lab&#39;s work to  [High-Low Tech](http://hlt.media.mit.edu) a couple of months ago--and he invited us back over to his place, to experiment with some new software that [Erik Demaine](http://virtualglass.org/team.html), among others, have been working on. It&#39;s called [Virtual Glass](http://virtualglass.org),  essentially a CAD tool, that lets you experiment with different configurations of _cane_, and then see how the cane will appear once pulled. I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s the technical term, but that&#39;s what it seemed like to me. Making glass has a lot in common with pulling taffy and baking--at least in these early stages.+}

{+It was quite a show. In corner one, we&#39;ve got a dual furnaces, each heating a white-hot pull of glass. In the corner, a glory-hole -- an insanely-hot furnace in which dabs of glass are reheated and heated. A blowtorch off in the corner, braying its firey mess. For some additional (anthropological) thoughts on the subject, please see: [Conner, Erin: Embodied knowledge in glassblowing the experience of meaning and the struggle towards proficiency](http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=1&amp;cad=rja&amp;ved=0CDgQFjAA&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.scasss.uu.se%2FIIS2005%2Ftotal_webb%2Ftot_html%2Fpapers%2Fembodied_knowledge.pdf&amp;ei=mR7CUPSeOLGG0QHL0IHICA&amp;usg=AFQjCNEurTuRIijIgxjSkvYBr88V9uoA7g&amp;sig2=OtTGICr3kqIYG77wUhMrdQ). +}

{+Watching Peter, Eric, &amp; Marty work was impressive. They zipped around, waving flaming gobs of glass, while we gawked and generally got in the way. In the end, they managed to make one of the designs that we came up with. It seemed pretty intricate, involving bonding together several different pieces of cane in a variety of ways, and then dousing the resultant mess in yet more glass. Something like making an elaborate pastry. The finished cane came ot pretty cool too--this is part of the end, that they let me take home after it had annealed. +}
