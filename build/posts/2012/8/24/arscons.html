<h2>Arch Linux <span class="amp">&amp;</span> Thinkpad X40: A love&nbsp;story</h2>
<p>I&#8217;ve used Arch Linux for years &#8212; always a bit ineptly, I must admit &#8212; and a while back, mostly because of a new job (and the allure of ditching my open-source sensibilities and using Adobe <span class="caps">CS</span>), I switched to a Mac. I&#8217;ve been happy enough, but there&#8217;s something about coding in Snow Leopard or Lion or Cat or whatever we&#8217;re on, that I&#8217;ve never really liked. Too slick, maybe. I find I work better in heavily constrained&nbsp;environments. </p>
<p>So I&#8217;ve always had another machine around for my &#8220;real&#8221; coding work. That lot falls to an old Thinkpad X40 that I hauled around on a six-month jaunt in Nicaragua, when I was taking some time off from college and working for <a href="http://ticotimes.net">The Tico Times</a>. I was running Ubuntu then. It was like a rock&#8212;it&#8217;s still going strong. Over the years, I&#8217;ve amassed a small armada of X40s: you can get one in working-order on <a href="http://www.ebay.com/sch/Laptops-Netbooks-/175672/i.html?_nkw=x40%20thinkpad&amp;_mPrRngCbx=1&amp;_udlo=10&amp;_udhi=76">Ebay</a> for under $65 bucks. How can you&nbsp;resist?</p>
<h2>Arch +&nbsp;Arduino</h2>
<p>On my latest X40, I&#8217;m running Arch off&#8217;ve a charming <span class="caps">4GB</span> <span class="caps">USB</span> stick (the X40s on Ebay are almost always stripped of their hard-drives). It&#8217;s a little pokey, particularly on writing to disk, but I couldn&#8217;t be happier. And my little, cranky, skull-bucket of a Thinkpad feels as roomy as the glossy 13&#8221; MacBook Pro I usually work and the keyboard has none of the mushy play. (Read up on Mako&#8217;s <a href="http://mako.cc/copyrighteous/20111207-00">great post</a> on the great swindle that is the 16:9 screen ratio &#8212; which is why the X40 <em>is</em> actually as large as the&nbsp;<span class="caps">MBP</span>).</p>
<p>At any rate, all of that doesn&#8217;t change the fact that it&#8217;s an antiquated machine and I use it primarily for text editing. Not much else. I like coding on it&#8212;there&#8217;s no electro-peace like a tiling windows manager (Awesome) and someone else&#8217;s fantastic&nbsp;.vimrc. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been using <a href="http://bdm.cc">Brian Mayton&#8217;s</a> Makefile (<a href="https://github.com/samjacoby/avr/blob/master/makefiles.templates/avr_makefile_brian">file</a>) to compile my avr programs&#8212;but honestly, I love the convenience of the Arduino libraries and all the rest, even if they&#8217;re anathema to Assembly&nbsp;Cowboys. </p>
<p>Not growing up on embedded programming, the whole <code>(1 &lt;&lt; PB4)</code>, alas, does not quite feel like first nature. One sore spot has been the Arduino <span class="caps">IDE</span>, which in all its muscular Java-ness, is a bit much for the X40 to&nbsp;handle. </p>
<p>So&#8212;how do you use the Arduino libraries in the comfort of your own <code>vim</code> config? There are a couple of ways. I use <a href="https://github.com/suapapa/arscons">Arscons</a>, a python build script, that makes the process relatively&nbsp;painless. </p>
<p>First, install the&nbsp;necessaries: </p>
<div class="codehilite"><pre><span class="n">sudo</span> <span class="n">pacman</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="n">S</span> <span class="n">install</span> <span class="n">python</span><span class="o">-</span><span class="n">pyserial</span> <span class="n">scons</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Then grab the <a href="https://github.com/suapapa/arscons">SConstruct</a> file and copy it into your sketch folder. Run <code>scons</code>, and let the magic unfold. Maybe. Didn&#8217;t work for me outt&#8217;ve the box. Because I have several versions of avr-gcc, a conflict prevented programs from compiling correctly. I edited the SConstruct file to make it work right&#8212;in my case, I just modified the <code>AVR_BIN_PREFIX</code> setting to point to the actual Arduino install of <code>avr-gcc</code>. That broke <code>avrdude</code>, but such is life. I don&#8217;t know exactly what was amiss, but it seemed to have worked&nbsp;fine.</p>
<p>So that&#8217;s that&#8212;not so grand. Scons is basically Make&#8212;or does the same things, at least&#8212;and lets you use Python rather than all of that gibberish. There <em>are</em> <code>Makefiles</code> for Arduino that do the exact same thing&#8212;but they are even more of a code&nbsp;soup.  </p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">UPDATE</span>:</strong> I checked in with Dave and Arduino ships with its own version of avr-gcc with a number of necessary&nbsp;tweaks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NOTE</span>:</strong> Yes, yes, I know I can use an external editor with Arduino, but I don&#8217;t like doing that for some reason. I end up being confused about where I should be&nbsp;editing. </p>    </section>
