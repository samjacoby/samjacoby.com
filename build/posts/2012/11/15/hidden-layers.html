        <p><em>The journey continues. This is part of my work as a research assistant in the <a href="http://hlt.media.mit.edu">High-Low Tech</a> group at the <span class="caps">MIT</span> Media&nbsp;Lab.</em></p>
<p>This is the design that I drew the board up from. Looks pretty good, right? Well, I was happy: lot&#8217;s of complicated little parts, colors&#8212;enough for me to feel like I was doing my&nbsp;job.  </p>

<p>I sent off the gerber files, and had another board made by the good men and women of <span class="caps">AP</span> Circuits. They did bang-up job, naturally. I was walking around the lab with them, and Mark said, &#8220;That from <span class="caps">AP</span> Circuits?&#8221; You can spot one of these gems from across the room&#8212;it&#8217;s in the fancy-pants solder mask, apparently. Whatever the reason, you can spot one of these gems from across the room: circuit bling. I happily toasted it&nbsp;up.  </p>

<p>Now, some of the savvier among you may note that there are substantial errors in this circuit. To you, I tip my hat. I was&nbsp;oblivious.</p>
<p>At the moment, our hero is plugging the board into his computer, ready to bask in the radiance of its green, power&nbsp;<span class="caps">LED</span>.</p>
<p>Nothing. Poke around a bit. Nothing. Pull out the multimeter. Could there be a bridge in thin traces of the mini-<span class="caps">USB</span> connectior? No. 5V streaming in. That looks good. But, hmm, streaming out? Ah&#8230;well, not so much. And then I see it. None of the grounds are connected. Only one half of my circuits are&nbsp;routed.  </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s the story. It&#8217;s not so grand. At some point in the development process, I did something bad. To simplify my design, I used a ground plane&#8212;a single sheet of copper that the ground of all of the traces plugged into. After &#8220;pouring&#8221; the ground (kind&#8217;ve like the fill tool in paint, or something), the screen was looking a little crowded. I turned off its display. Great. In so doing, though, I also turned off the airwires<sup><a id="airwires-mark" href="#airwires-note">1</a></sup>
 that it came with. Naturally, I then promptly forgot I did any such thing and proceeded on my merry way. Getting the board made and all the&nbsp;rest.  </p>
<p>It turns out, though, the job wasn&#8217;t really done. The pouring algorithm had done its job, sure&#8212;but it had left a number of sections for me, it&#8217;s human-companion to resolve. The groundplane needed a number of additional airwires that I never added back in. My circuits, then, were a series of orphans, plugged into nothing but themselves! I needed <em>17</em> additional wires. I was&nbsp;crushed. </p>
<p>At any rate, lesson learned. Don&#8217;t switch off views and think you&#8217;ve solved any problems. You&nbsp;haven&#8217;t.  </p>
<div id="airwires-note" class="footnote">1. <p>Airwires are just a wire that you&#8217;re supposed to solder on later, so it&#8217;s displayed as a single line in Eagle. That&#8217;s all well and good and sometimes a well-placed airwire can take care of a number of problems&#8212;but they&#8217;re difficult and tedious to solder, and really, if you&#8217;re having a custom-board made, you should take care not to have&nbsp;any.</p><a class="footnote-note-number" href="#airwires-mark">â†©</a></div>    </section>
