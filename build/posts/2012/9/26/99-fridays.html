<p>I had a batch that I tested with an Arduino and an <span class="caps">IR</span> light array. The array&#8212;it turned out&#8212;wasn&#8217;t the right wavelength, so though the response was good in the comfort of my office, once we were trying to blanket an entire space, it didn&#8217;t work all that well. Valentin scrounged up some of the right LEDs though, and that worked fine. <em>Then</em> we had some issues with the receiver&#8217;s error-detection and noise-rejection &#8212; but managed to get around it with some jerry-regging. The morial is what it always is: read the datasheet. Once things were squared away, the <span class="caps">IR</span> transmitter was synced to <a href="http://bdm.cc">Brian&#8217;s</a> <span class="caps">OSC</span> stream that distributed levels and <span class="caps">FFT</span> bands to whomever was listening to the server. When the emitter pulsed, the LEDs pulsed-with. Not bad. Even figured out some nice <span class="caps">PWM</span> action,&nbsp;too.  </p>

<p>Here are the final batch. Each throwie was attached to a clothespin so that people could attach them to their clothes.

{+title: 99 Fridays &amp;amp; IR Throwies+}
{+summary: The little guys hit the big time.+}
{+date: 2012-9-26 10:08:23+}
{+---+}
{+Thanks to the inestimable efforts of [Valentin Huen](http://colorsaregood.com/index.php), we pulled together _500_ IR Throwies for the Media Lab&#39;s 99 Friday&#39;s party series. 99 Fridays is all-out dance-party, albeit a very Media-Lab-ish one. It&#39;s spiced by projects that people pull together from their research--or whatever, really. I was racing against a &lt;span class=&#34;small-caps&#34;&gt;CHI&lt;/span&gt; paper deadline, so Valentin heroically recruited a small army of people to scale up the [IR Throwies](/projects/ir-led-throwies/) project for the last party. +}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/40358770@N00/8070857656/&#34; title=&#34;IR Throwies by s_jacoby, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8177/8070857656_764138f70f.jpg&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;334&#34; alt=&#34;IR Throwies&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#39;, &#34;500 IR Throwies under construction (photo courtesy of Valentine Huen).&#34;) }}+}

{+I had a batch that I tested with an Arduino and an IR light array. The array--it turned out--wasn&#39;t the right frequency of light, so though the response was good in the comfort of my office, once we were trying to blanket an entire space, it didn&#39;t work well. Valentin scrounged up some of the right LEDs though, and that worked fine. Read the goddamn datasheet: that&#39;s always the lesson. The IR transmitter was synced to Brian&#39;s OSC stream that distributed levels and FFT of various bands to whomever was listening. All the LEDs, then, pulsed with the music. Pretty good. +}

Testing functionality.&#34;) }} +}

{+And here are the final batch. I wish I had some shots from the party with everyone dancing and all, but I had to take off once we had them working. We heaped batches of them around the room, and as the night proceeded, people attached them all over themselves. #FUTURERAVES. +}

{+Not a bad showing, all in all. And cheap -- though it starts to add up in quantity!+}</pre>
