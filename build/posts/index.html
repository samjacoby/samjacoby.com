                        <p>Over at <a href="http://formlabs.com">Formlabs</a>, we've been putting together a new frontend application using Backbone + Marionette. I've done a fair amount with Backbone, over the years, but have never really grasped it. I mean, I understand the basics, but the lack of prescriptive patterns has always troubled me. I <em>like</em> to know the right way of doing things, so the free-and-easy choices that Backbone presents has always been a bit challenging. It's not that I mind formulating my own patterns, it's that design-patterns can provide a window into the choices that an author's intentions. It helps explain <em>why</em> something is designed the way it is, rather than just how. I find that useful.  </p>

                        <p>A group of my friends periodically comes together in (increasingly) far-flung parts of the world to remind each other of our mutual affection. The most recent round took us to Newfoundland, a ragged slash of land off the Eastern coast of Canada. The ostensible object was the Long Range Traverse, a trail across the mountains that run the length of Newfoundland's <a href="http://www.pc.gc.ca/eng/pn-np/nl/grosmorne/index.aspx">Gros Morne National Park</a>. This was as unlikely a mission as any for this particular crew. I wouldn't say that we're wholly unathletic, but it's not what springs to mind. That said, we're all reasonably competent at  various things—from television trivia to expounding conservative ideology—so with a bit of prep (see below), it worked out. It was pretty, too.  </p>

                      <p>I&#8217;ve been returning to aquariums with a force, lately, rigging-up a new set-up with a couple of neon tetras and a dozen-odd cherry chrimp that I picked up from Ebay.<sup><a id="shrimps-1-mark" href="#shrimps-1-note">1</a></sup>
 I got started with aquariums years ago, in elementary school&#8212;I don&#8217;t recall why, exactly&#8212;but perhaps it had something to do with growing up by <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=allans+aquarium&amp;aq=f&amp;oq=allans+aquarium">Allan&#8217;s Aquarium</a>, one of the finest fish stores&nbsp;around.  </p>
<p>At any rate, with aquariums on the mind, I dredged up my very first forays onto the <em>Internet</em>. These are gems from the <code>rec.aquaria</code> usenet, now archived on Google Groups. I remember posting these, sitting on my dad&#8217;s lap on the dial-up that we had from&nbsp;<span class="caps">UCLA</span>. </p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sample, posted in September of&nbsp;1996:</p>

                        <p>The Glass Lab is something apart at MIT. Less lasers, more 15th-century Italian glassblowing. I'd assumed that it was a hold-over from the days when chemistry departments blew their own glass and the like, but I believe it comes from the materials' science department, or some such. There is a much coveted lottery every semester, where a lucky dozen or-so get a chance to learn the craft. I've missed every opportunity, alas.  </p>

                        <p><em>The journey continues. This is part of my work as a research assistant in the <a href="http://hlt.media.mit.edu">High-Low Tech</a> group at the MIT Media Lab.</em></p>
<p>This is the design that I drew the board up from. Looks pretty good, right? Well, I was happy: lot's of complicated little parts, colors--enough for me to feel like I was doing my job.  </p>

                        <p>Recuperating this week from a grand time in New York City. We converged on its gray shores last week to stop by the <a href="http://summit.oshwa.org/">Open Source Hardware Summit</a>, where people vaguely gesticulated in the direction of "open source" and show-cased their projects. The good men (and they are that) of <a href="http://drinkicd.com">Industry City Distillery</a> were there, handing out thimbles of vodka.</p>

                        <p>Thanks to the inestimable efforts of <a href="http://colorsaregood.com/index.php">Valentin Huen</a>, we pulled together a whopping <a href="/projects/ir-led/throwies/">500 IR Throwies</a> for the Media Lab's latest 99 Friday dance-party <em>cum</em> project-showcase. I use "we" rather loosely: I was racing against a conference paper deadline, so Valentin heroically recruited a small army of people to scale up the <a href="/projects/ir-led-throwies/">IR Throwies</a> project. It came off pretty well.</p>

                        <p>In preparation for a workshop last weekend--I populated the ten bare-bones boards I'd picked up from Advanced Circuits (see my last <a href="/posts/2012/8/31/building-boards/">post</a>). I've done a bit of this now, but with <a href="http://bdm.cc">Brian's</a> ever-essential help, I got really cruising. The ten boards probably took about an hour with a few hiccups.</p>

                        <p>My circuit board order came in -- it's always astonishing how tiny the things are, these boards are about the size of two postage stamps, side-by-side. The "barebones" option from Advanced Circuits is a pretty good deal too. These cost $8.90 apiece, which is pretty reasonable. I know that <a href="http://apccircuits.com">APC Circuits</a> has really quick turn-around for boards with solder mask and such, but I didn't need it. I'm mostly proud for remembering not to pour a groundplane, as it makes it a pain to solder.

                        <p>I've been working on the software for TapClip--which is rolling along, in preparation for a workshop next week. So far, it's working pretty well, though the <code>minim</code> library is causing me some grief. There appears to be a noticeable lag-time when using <code>loadSample</code> to queue a <code>.wav</code> file in memory. </p>

                        <p>Every time I send off Gerbers for production, I am baffled by the array of files that the CAM job in Eagle generates. I'm happy to be ignorant. That's fine. The issue is, when you upload your files to most board fabs, they cheerily list the half-dozen odd things you've sent them--and ask you what they are? Top solder mask? NC drill file? I know nothing of this. So--some research later, and this is what we've got.  </p>

                        <p>I've used Arch Linux for years -- always a bit ineptly, I must admit -- and a while back, mostly because of a new job (and the allure of ditching my open-source sensibilities and using Adobe CS), I switched to a Mac. I've been happy enough, but there's something about coding in Snow Leopard or Lion or Cat or whatever we're on, that I've never really liked. Too slick, maybe. I find I work better in heavily constrained environments. </p>

                      <p>With some consternation, I&#8217;ve overhauled my&nbsp;website. </p>
<p>Much is due to the fine work of <a href="http://stevelosh.com">Steve Losh</a>, whose work I&#8217;ve assiduously cribbed, both in web design, <code>.vim</code> configs, and much&nbsp;else.</p>
<p>This site is powered by <a href="http://hyde.github.com/">Hyde</a>, which is complex enough to make me feel smart, and simple enough to be actually useful. The <a href="http://goldengridsystem.com">Golden Grid System</a> gave me all of the nifty &#8220;Responsive Web&#8221; tricks for free. Fun fact: I helped put Ethan Marcotte&#8217;s <a href="http://www.abookapart.com/products/responsive-web-design">e-book</a> together for <a href="http://abookapart.com">A Book Apart</a> back when I worked for&nbsp;Threepress.</p>
<p>The code for this website is hosted on <a href="https://github.com/samjacoby/samjacoby.com">GitHub</a>. Not much to see, but knock yourself out if you&#8217;re so&nbsp;inclined. </p>
