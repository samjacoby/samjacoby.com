        <p>I&#8217;ve started tackling the clutch in earnest. They&#8217;re notorious in CB500s and Honda overhauled them in the 550. Mine has been giving me trouble on-and-off since I picked it up, but recently, it&#8217;s started to grow worse. It&#8217;s close to impossible to hit neutral while hot &#8212; which is pretty standard fare &#8212; but more troubling, the clutch hasn&#8217;t been disengaging while in first, so I&#8217;ve got to keep the engine revved to prevent it from bogging down. One hand on the throttle, one on the brake &#8212; not a good&nbsp;situation. </p>
<p>I started by breaking into the parts bike, just to get a sense of how the pieces fit together &#8212; which has been useful. It&#8217;s a bit nerve-wracking to begin wrenching without having any idea what&#8217;s in there (though I have the manuel), so it&#8217;s nice to have something to play with. Tackling the clutch has been a chore. The old gasket is just about fused to the crankcase, and it&#8217;s taking a couple of soaks with various solvents and a razorblade to clean it off. Nice and shiny now,&nbsp;though. </p>
<p>I checked out the clutch plates from both machines &#8212; neither were so amazing. I checked the steel plates for warping against a glass plate and a feeler gauge. They mostly seemed <span class="caps">OK</span>, actually, though according to many reports, that&#8217;s unlikely. The friction plates showed a bit more wear, but they also weren&#8217;t warped and basically good enough to use. More concerning was that their cork pattern was clearly not stock, nor was it any of the other well-known cork facings (square, etc.) I deglazed (I hope), the steel plates with some fine sandpaper. I also measured the springs, which looked basically&nbsp;fine.     </p>

<p>I picked up some synthetic Mobile grease for no reason other than it was the most expensive, and I figured why-the-hell-not. Turned out to be red, which I don&#8217;t&nbsp;like.  </p>
<p>The lifter assembly and bearing went in pretty smoothly. I found a new pushrod on Ebay &#8212; technically belongs to a <span class="caps">CB450</span>, but it seems to fit in there pretty nicely (same 8mm diameter), and it&#8217;s i good shape. Getting an <span class="caps">OEM</span> clutch cable was a good idea too. A clutch cable was one of the first things that I bought when I got the bike. Now, the better part of a year later, I know that it&#8217;s some non-<span class="caps">OEM</span> junk that&#8217;s not even close to the right&nbsp;length.</p>

<p>The whole thing came back together well enough, and though I wouldn&#8217;t exactly call my clutch smooth-shifting (the plates probably do need to be replaced), but it&#8217;s working well enough for&nbsp;now. </p>    </section>
