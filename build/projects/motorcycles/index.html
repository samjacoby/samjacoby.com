<p>Fall ride outside of&nbsp;Boston.  </p>
</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Obeying a widely-known primordial need within the soul, I acquired a 1972 Honda motorcycle in the summer of 2013. It was (then) a 41 year-old machine and requires continuous attention. That is part of the fun. This is mostly a place for me to keep track of&nbsp;notes. </p>
<p>I&#8217;ve found great satisfaction in working on it: tracing down corroded electrical connections, adjusting the timing <span class="amp">&amp;</span> valves, rebuilding the cylinders—a nice change of pace from the technological-computer arts where I usually find&nbsp;myself. </p>

## [-Right-Hand Switch Rebuild-]
[-For awhile I&#39;ve had terrible problems with the electrics (particular the starter), so I decided to restore that whole pathway, from the right-hand switch (home to the ignition button) on down to the starter solenoid (which feeds the starter motor) on to the starter itself.   -]

[-{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12449722364/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;My shattered starter button. A pretty common problem on these bikes, apparently.&#34;)}}-]

[-There are some great write-ups in the SOHC4 forums on how to rebuild the bars where the switch lives--so I&#39;ll leave most of it to the experts. The toughest part of the whole job was simply removing the switch in the first place. Some of the screws were pretty badly rusted and stripped (my fault), so I had to work some magic with a screw extractor. Those things have saved me twice now.-]

[-{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12450255044/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Harbor Freight&#39;s finest at work and play. This was really hard.&#34;)}}-]

[-Removing the screw. A real pain, as I didn&#39;t have a vise or anything to hold the bars steady, so they were wiggling all over the place. Kind&#39;ve had to brace it and get at it from beneath--and then hammer upwards into myself. -]

[-{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12449907513/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Triumph.&#34;)}}-]

[-The screws were mangled, but rather than getting myself to Ace and figuring out what the threads were to replace, so I ordered replacement screws direct from Bike Bandit. It&#39;s insane that this stuff is still stocked, in little individually-wrapped plastic bags with part numbers no less.-]

[-{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12449225635/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;375&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Removed from the bars and disassembled.&#34;)}}-]

[-Here&#39;s everything pulled off and disassembled. You can see some of the remaining shreds of PVC tubing that the cable ran through (I replaced it with heatshrink).-]

[-## Clutch-]
[-I&#39;ve started tackling the clutch in earnest. They&#39;re notorious in CB500s and Honda overhauled them in the 550. Mine has been giving me trouble on-and-off since I picked it up, but recently, it&#39;s started to grow worse. It&#39;s close to impossible to hit neutral while hot -- which is pretty standard fare -- but more troubling, the clutch hasn&#39;t been disengaging while in first, so I&#39;ve got to keep the engine revved to prevent it from bogging down. One hand on the throttle, one on the brake -- not a good situation. -]

[-I started by breaking into the parts bike, just to get a sense of how the pieces fit together -- which has been useful. It&#39;s a bit nerve-wracking to begin wrenching without having any idea what&#39;s in there (though I have the manuel), so it&#39;s nice to have something to play with. Tackling the clutch has been a chore. The old gasket is just about fused to the crankcase, and it&#39;s taking a couple of soaks with various solvents and a razorblade to clean it off. Nice and shiny now, though. -]

[-I checked out the clutch plates from both machines -- neither were so amazing. I checked the steel plates for warping against a glass plate and a feeler gauge. They mostly seemed OK, actually, though according to many reports, that&#39;s unlikely. The friction plates showed a bit more wear, but they also weren&#39;t warped and basically good enough to use. More concerning was that their cork pattern was clearly not stock, nor was it any of the other well-known cork facings (square, etc.) I deglazed (I hope), the steel plates with some fine sandpaper. I also measured the springs, which looked basically fine.     -]

{+{% mark excerpt %}+}
{+Obeying a widely-known primordial need within the soul, I was compelled to acquire a 1972 Honda motorcycle in the summer of 2013.[^soul] It&#39;s a 41 year-old machine and requires continuous attention. That is part of the fun. This is mostly a place for me to keep track of notes. +}
{+{% endmark %}+}

{+I&#39;ve found great satisfaction in working on it: tracing down corroded electrical connections, adjusting the timing,  changing the tires. I lean back, hands dabbed with oil and inhale the petroleum&#39;s intoxicating bouquet... Why, I just might write [a book](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_and_the_Art_of_Motorcycle_Maintenance) about it.[^zen-1]+}

{+## Maintenance Table+}
{+I&#39;ve been working my way down this, little by little. It&#39;s pretty handy. +}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/10817763986/&#34; title=&#34;HSM500550_9 by s_jacoby, on Flickr&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://farm8.staticflickr.com/7405/10817763986_cd48417a9f.jpg&#34; width=&#34;368&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; alt=&#34;HSM500550_9&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&#39;, &#34;From when charts were king.&#34;) }}+}


{+## Right-Hand Switch Rebuild+}
{+For awhile I&#39;ve had terrible problems with the electrics (particular the starter), so I decided to restore that whole pathway, from the right-hand switch (home to the ignition button) on down to the starter solenoid (which feeds the starter motor) on to the starter itself.   +}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12449722364/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;My shattered starter button. A pretty common problem on these bikes, apparently.&#34;)}}+}

{+There are some great write-ups in the SOHC4 forums on how to rebuild the bars where the switch lives--so I&#39;ll leave most of it to the experts. The toughest part of the whole job was simply removing the switch in the first place. Some of the screws were pretty badly rusted and stripped (my fault), so I had to work some magic with a screw extractor. Those things have saved me twice now.+}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12450255044/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;480&#34; height=&#34;640&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Harbor Freight&#39;s finest at work and play. This was really hard.&#34;)}}+}

{+Removing the screw. A real pain, as I didn&#39;t have a vise or anything to hold the bars steady, so they were wiggling all over the place. Kind&#39;ve had to brace it and get at it from beneath--and then hammer upwards into myself. +}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12449907513/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;500&#34; height=&#34;375&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Triumph.&#34;)}}+}

{+The screws were mangled, but rather than getting myself to Ace and figuring out what the threads were to replace, so I ordered replacement screws direct from Bike Bandit. It&#39;s insane that this stuff is still stocked, in little individually-wrapped plastic bags with part numbers no less.+}

{+{{ macros.render_figure(&#39;&lt;iframe src=&#34;http://www.flickr.com/photos/samjacoby/12449225635/in/set-72157636792385405/player/&#34; width=&#34;375&#34; height=&#34;500&#34; frameborder=&#34;0&#34; allowfullscreen webkitallowfullscreen mozallowfullscreen oallowfullscreen msallowfullscreen&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&#39;, &#34;Removed from the bars and disassembled.&#34;)}}+}

{+Here&#39;s everything pulled off and disassembled. You can see some of the remaining shreds of PVC tubing that the cable ran through (I replaced it with heatshrink).+}

{+I picked up some synthetic Mobile grease for no reason other than it was the most expensive, and I figured why-the-hell-not. Turned out to be red, which I don&#39;t like.  +}

{+The lifter assembly and bearing went in pretty smoothly. I found a new pushrod on Ebay -- technically belongs to a CB450, but it seems to fit in there pretty nicely (same 8mm diameter), and it&#39;s i good shape. Getting an OEM clutch cable was a good idea too. A clutch cable was one of the first things that I bought when I got the bike. Now, the better part of a year later, I know that it&#39;s some non-OEM junk that&#39;s not even close to the right length.+}

{+The whole thing came back together well enough, and though I wouldn&#39;t exactly call my clutch smooth-shifting (the plates probably do need to be replaced), but it&#39;s working well enough for now. +}

{+## Replacing Fork Seals+}
{+I wanted to get this done before I took the ride out to Iowa City. I&#39;ve had a very slight leak on my front fork seals--not much, but enough to show an issue. Of greater concern are persistent handling issues I&#39;ve had since I picked up the bike in the summer of 2013. I noticed it early on -- on one of the very first rides I took, in fact -- a pronounced wobble when deaccellerating from the 40s or so. It turns out that this is a fairly common issue, usually resolved by replacing the original head bearings with a tapered set. New fork oil could only help, though I think I&#39;ve got deeper-seated issues there than just that.  +}

{+## Oil Pump Seals+}

{+## Oil Switch+}
{+I&#39;ve been trying to track down an oil leak in my left crankcase -- it&#39;s never been an enormous amount of oil, not enough to stop me riding, but a pain nonetheless. I&#39;ve done the little tricks with the baby powder, and I thought it was the oilpan seal for awhile.  +}

{+I&#39;ve been having a long-standing leak +}
