                    <h1>Walk this way if you're a beginner</h1>
<p>This template was created to look at its code. So you should spend about
5% of your time looking at the web from the outside and the other 95%
tinkering with things under the hood.</p>
<p>The template is not perfect nor does it contain the best practices. It
is not even consistent. It is designed to help you with the learning
process. If you follow the steps below, you'll get a pretty good picture of
how things work. Every step adds some new features and builds upon the
previous one.</p>
<h2>1. Site structure and configuration file</h2>
<p>The site is made of two folders and a <a href="http://hyde.github.com/config.html" title="Hyde configuration">Hyde configuration</a>
file. The folders are <strong>content</strong> and <strong>layout</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>content</strong> contains all your page content, blog articles, pictures and
resources like CSS and JavaScript. Everything that is unique is here.</p>
<p><strong>layout</strong> contains templates and macros. Everything that you'll want to
reuse is here.</p>
<h2>2. Jinja2 template</h2>
<p><strong>base.j2</strong> is a very short and simple Jinja2 template. This way you can
concentrate on some of the basic features. Notice meta and context
variables invocation inside curly braces, dynamic media path generation
and running all content through the Markdown filter.</p>
<p><strong>macros.j2</strong> contains macros for common and repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>For more information or to try something new, visit the extensive <a href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/templates/" title="Jinja2 documentation">Jinja2
documentation</a>.</p>
<h2>3. Content</h2>
<p>Look at the three files in this order: <a href="index.html">index.html</a>,
<a href="first-steps.html">first-steps.html</a> and <a href="about.html">about.html</a>.</p>
<p><a href="index.html">Index</a> extends the base layout in the classic Jinja way and
fills the content block with some simple Markdown data.</p>
<p><a href="first-steps.html">First steps</a> goes a step furher. It introduces the
in-file metadata that plugins will use to extend and fill the layout. It
also uses some new Markdown features.</p>
<p><a href="about.html">About</a> has a <strong>default_block</strong> metadata and mixes Markdown
content with Jinja templates.</p>
<h2>4. Advanced sections</h2>
<p>While searching and navigating this template you'll find more files and
sections than mentioned on this page (something like <strong>meta.yaml</strong>
files, the <strong>content/advanced</strong> folder or other Jinja templates). They
are files needed for the <a href="advanced/overview.html">advanced topics</a> so
just ignore them at the beginning.  They will start to make sense while
you're working through the template or will be explicitly explained when
the right time comes.</p>        </article>
